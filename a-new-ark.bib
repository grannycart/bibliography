	    The first page has a graph that shows how the projects Stein built are related to the

	    and Howard style Garden Cities in America.
	    This book contains a chapter on the Valley Stream Project (not built) one goal of which
	    was to create jobs in the construction industry after the war.  Stein cites it as a
	    major influence on later projects that were built, including the separation of road/ped
	    and parking away from housing.
	    Radburn is interesting for not having a Greenbelt (which is key for Howards GCs),
	    instead, Stein has them look towards the interior of their superblocks (the unit scale
	    at which he designs) for green.
