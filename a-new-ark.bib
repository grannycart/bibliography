	    major influence on later projects that were built, including the separation of road/ped

	    Radburn is interesting for not having a Greenbelt (which is key for Howards GCs),

They had originally gone to the Bloomberg administration asking them to rezone this area from M1-1 to an MX like all the other MXs. But DCP said they were too busy to look at it because it was in the waning days of the administration. Gib said that actually turned out to be a blessing because they now think a regular MX rezoning would have just resulted in residential development. Their new proposal is for MX with required manufacturing on the first two floors, and 3 residential above. Gib also pointed out that CB8 went to DCP _requesting_ this MX rezoning as a way to promote economic development in the area.},
