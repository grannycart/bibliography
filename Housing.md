  comment={JCHS looks into using the metric of 30 percent of income for afforable housing. They compare it to the more accurate "residual income" measure and find that virtually everyone who is low income is housing burdened, and almost nobody who is medium to high income is. But the thirty percent rule of thumb is accurate enough for macroeconomic and rough work. Covers the history of the 30 percent guideline, and that it was originally 25 percent --- the idea being that one should spend one week's income on rent.},

% Turns out, despite being more or less arbitrary, the 30 percent rule of thumb is good enough for a lot of things, and has the benefit of being easy for everyone to understand. (Much like Chef's "17 years old" rule.)

  date={2023-09-11},  
  comment={Despite being the largest city in the world, and overall wealthy, Tokyo has very affordable housing. This is a result of unfettered development, value placed on new construction by consumers, investment in transit, and little to no sense of historical preservation or value.},  
  category={Urbanism, Housing, tokyo}  
}  
% This shows that the econ 101 supply v demand / neoliberal model DOES work... in the simplist model you can come up with.  
% Tokyo is exceptional from other major world cities in critical ways (many of them laid out in the article as if they are flaws that other world cities need to address):  
	% Tokyo has virtually no restriction on development _in its entire greater metro area_. This is like saying it's NYC's fault that residents of NJ CT and LI don't want to allow developments in their towns. Indeed, the article LITERALLY states that NYC "stopped building new transit lines and started restricting new development along existing lines" and then claims that growth stalled in Garden City Long Island. As if NYC has any control over what happens on Long Island. As if it could even be _constitutional_ for NYC to have some kind of control over development in NJ or CT.  
	% Tokyo has no historical buildings at all (and no parks). People just want the newest construction. They just dispose of anything old and there's no regulations or bodies to prevent that from happening. Is that really the housing culture _anyone_ wants in NYC or London?  
	% Tokyo doesn't seem to be constrained by land space, it just keeps consuming its suburbs and making them part of the city. NYC will never have control over the land space of the 5 boroughs themselves.  
	% Construction seems to be cheap in Tokyo. I can almost guarantee this is not because of a lack of regulation. There are a huge number of economic factors that affect construction costs, not just zoning regulations. This is a wholly different problem from housing (that rapidly gets into the space of equity and how well construction worker in a dangeroud and difficult job are paid).  
	% It is difficult to imagine ANY scenario in NYC and London where any new construction is NOT high-end luxury construction. ALL the things that make development expensive in London and NYC come together and ensure that new development is almost always _exclusively_ for rich people. Building more high-rises in the context of these cities only makes the city more accessible to rich people. There is NO model in the forseeable 100-year future where so much low-income housing is being built that it lowers the cost of housing for low-income people.

  comment={This article looks at the problems of the housing market and reaches the conclusion that Vienna has possibly the best solution: massive amounts of public housing available to 80 percent of the population, and limited-profit housing associations (restricted to charging rents that reflect costs, and extra profits have to go to constructing more social housing).

% One other interesting note: Vienna is surprisingly far more diverse than I would have guessed, with a foreign-born population slightly higher than NYC's. (total pop: around 2m)  
% "Vienna has succeeded in curbing the craving to own. It has done it by driving down the price of land through rezonings and rent control."  
% It's not clear to me that all of this couldn't be achieved simply through a strict rent-control program. What is "limited-profit" housing except a method of rent control? (It is, in fact, the same as Mitchell-Lama, the primary driver of affordability for those buildings being that they are rent-stabilized.) What is massive public housing other than a means of taking housing out of the capitalist market system? She doesn't deny this in the article, but as usual NYC's rent stabilization is left entirely unmentioned, even while there is much detail about NYC public housing. Nobody ever seems to want to talk about rent control/stabilization in NYC because it WORKS, even though it goes against the econ 101 supply/demand curve.

 abstract = {The standard view of housing markets holds that the flexibility of local housing supply–shaped by factors like geography and regulation–strongly affects the response of house prices, house quantities and population to rising housing demand. However, from 2000 to 2020, we find that higher income growth predicts the same growth in house prices, housing quantity, and population regardless of a city's estimated housing supply elasticity. We find the same pattern when we expand the sample to 1980 to 2020, use different elasticity measures, and when we instrument for local housing demand. Using a general demand-and-supply framework, we show that our findings imply that constrained housing supply is relatively unimportant in explaining differences in rising house prices among U.S. cities. These results challenge the prevailing view of local housing and labor markets and suggest that easing housing supply constraints may not yield the anticipated improvements in housing affordability.},  
}  
% Is this _finally_ the academic research that shows that supply/demand is a stupidly simple rule to apply to housing markets and has no bearing in real life? Once again common sense comes out on top: increasing income has much more to do with increasing housing prices than supply. (stupid Glaeser)

}  
% ``the federal government dedicated nearly $134 billion to homeowner subsidies. The MID accounted for the biggest chunk of the total, $71 billion, with real estate tax deductions, capital gains exclusions and other expenditures accounting for the rest. That number, $134 billion, was larger than the entire budgets of the Departments of Education, Justice and Energy combined for that year. It is a figure that exceeds half the entire gross domestic product of countries like Chile, New Zealand and Portugal.''   
% ``When we think of entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare immediately come to mind. But by any fair standard, the holy trinity of United States social policy should also include the mortgage-interest deduction — an enormous benefit that has also become politically untouchable.''   
% ``Americans assume that most poor families live in subsidized housing, the opposite is true; nationwide, only one in four households that qualifies for rental assistance receives it.''   
% ``Because of rising housing costs and stagnant wages, slightly more than half of all poor renting families in the country spend more than 50 percent of their income on housing costs, and at least one in four spends more than 70 percent. Yet America’s national housing policy gives affluent homeowners large benefits; middle-class homeowners, smaller benefits; and most renters, who are disproportionately poor, nothing. It is difficult to think of another social policy that more successfully multiplies America’s inequality in such a sweeping fashion''   
% The GI Bill was the largest social program ever -- and was specifically set up to not be accessible to people of color. This was decades before redlining even began.  
% ``Racial exclusion was Roosevelt’s first concession to pass the New Deal; his second, to avoid a tax revolt, was to rely on regressive and largely hidden payroll taxes to fund generous social-welfare programs. A result, the historian Michelmore observes, is that we “never asked ordinary taxpayers to pay for the economic security many soon came to expect as a matter of right.” In providing millions of middle-class families stealth benefits, the American government rendered itself invisible to those families, who soon came to see their success as wholly self-made. We forgot because we were not meant to remember.''   
% ``There is another reason most MID benefits accrue to the top, even among homeowners: You have to itemize your deductions to claim it. Most taxpayers don’t bother because they don’t make enough money to justify the hassle. In 2014, 1.5 million households earning between $40,000 and $50,000 a year claimed the MID, receiving an average benefit of $14 a month. That same year, 6.5 million households with earnings above $200,000 claimed the MID and enjoyed an average benefit of $391 a month. What this means in aggregate is that households with at least six-figure incomes receive more than four-fifths of the total value of mortgage interest and property-tax deductions.''   
% ``So why do we keep this “poor instrument” around, if the overarching goal of American federal housing policy is to create a nation of homeowners? Perhaps because the MID enjoys entrenched, unyielding support from a powerful real estate lobby. We often discuss the influence of the gun and pharmaceutical lobbies, but the real estate lobby has spent much more than either group. We often discuss the influence of the gun and pharmaceutical lobbies, but the real estate lobby has spent much more than either group.  According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the National Association of Realtors spent $64.8 million in lobbying efforts in 2016, making it second only to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in terms of dollars spent.''   
% ``Would we support reform that provided desperately needed housing relief to millions of low-income Americans if it meant that the net worth of those who owned expensive homes took a hit? The answer is almost certainly no, at least for owners of houses valued north of $500,000. Wealth granted by a bizarre government subsidy is still wealth, and once people have it, they’d prefer to keep it. When it comes to public housing for the rich, it becomes hard to break the cycle of welfare dependency. It’s why some Democratic leaders who represent districts with high housing prices, like Representative Nancy Pelosi (San Francisco) and Senator Chuck Schumer (New York), have been outspoken critics of MID reform, even if they are consistent backers of other equality-promoting initiatives.''   
% ``We tend to speak about the poor as if they didn’t live in the same society, as if our gains and their losses weren’t intertwined. Conservatives explain poverty by pointing to “individual factors,” like bad decisions or the rise of single-parent families; liberals refer to “structural causes,” like the decline of manufacturing or the historical legacies of racial discrimination. Usually pitted against each other, each perspective serves a similar function: letting us off the hook by asserting that there is a deep-rooted, troubling problem — more than one in six Americans does not make enough to afford basic necessities — that most of us bear no responsibility for.''

  comment={Proposes the thought experiment of a cultural shift towards accepting generally declining home prices, rather than our current expectation that they should always rise. Some benefits might include people making local decisions based on best choices for education or job growth rather than protecting home values. His thought experiment also includes getting rid of land use restrictions to increase supply of housing. He makes it clear that this is simply a thought experiment to get us thinking about the negative aspects of our current cultural values. References a paper by Ed Glaeser that finds that houses should cost about 200,000, if land restrictions were not in place, since land is the main variable in housing costs. That paper suggests that housing costs are higher in NYC and San Francisco because of land use restrictions.},

% Not really sure that land use restrictions are solely because home price protectionism. It seems like there's a thousand reasons for land use restrictions, and the RESULT is some protectionism for home prices. That seems like a natural outcome of cities to me.

  abstract={More than 500 local inclusionary zoning (IZ) programs have been implemented in communities across the country. In most cases, these IZ policies are adopted as part of a larger local strategy to expand housing options that are affordable to lower income households.  IZ policies have been adopted in a wide range of places, from big cities to suburban communities to rural areas. But what makes one community more quickly adopt an IZ policy than another community? Using a database developed in collaboration with the National CLT Network (now Grounded Solutions), researchers at NHC and the University of Maryland developed a model to explain the rate of IZ adoption in local jurisdictions across the country.  When states expressly authorize inclusionary zoning, local jurisdictions have an easier time adopting a local IZ program. Other community characteristics that are associated with adoption of a local IZ program include: higher population densities, higher shares of rent-burdened households, lower home ownership rates, and a lower share of Democratic voters. These research findings can help advocates target their education and outreach efforts as they seek to expand the number and the effectiveness of IZ programs across the country.},

Leveraging exogenous changes in neighborhood racial composition, we show that white departures in response to black arrivals were quantitatively large and accelerated between 1900 and 1930.  Our preferred estimates suggest that white flight was responsible for 34 percent of the increase in segregation over the 1910s and 50 percent over the 1920s.

Subsequently, housing-price inequality has risen to pre-War levels, while rent inequality has risen less. Combining both measures, we see inequality in housing consumption equivalents mirroring patterns in income across both space and time, according to an income elasticity of housing demand just below one.  These patterns occur mainly within cities, and are not explained by observed changes in dwelling characteristics or locations. Instead, recent increases in housing inequality are driven most by changes in the relative value of locations, seen especially through land.},

But by setting a limit to rent stabilization they created an incentive for landlords to drive rents up until they could reach the vacancy decontrol point and make their apartment free-market rent.

Against that backdrop, support for Mr. Trump and for the British withdrawal known as Brexit are just imperfect vehicles through which someone can yell, “Stop.”'' the ``gaps between the economic elite and the general public are created not by differences in expertise but in priorities.'' Covers an experiment published in Science that showed that while a big portion of the American public would divide the equally over efficiently, this was not true of people attending Yale law school, who  divided the pie efficiently over equally. Argues for rent control: ``Economists almost uniformly argue that rent control laws are a terrible tool to try to make housing more affordable. As Paul Krugman once wrote, “the analysis of rent control is among the best-understood issues in all of economics, and — among economists, anyway — one of the least controversial.” Yet among people grappling with soaring rents, the policies are persistently popular — even, recently, in the free-market-oriented boomtowns of Silicon Valley.  It’s easy for an economist to chalk up support for rent control as idiocy that depresses the home construction that might reduce housing prices for everyone. I have thought of it that way.  But maybe it is really important for people who live in a place to be able to stay there indefinitely. Maybe the idea that things should stay the way they are, without new people moving in and new buildings going up, is not as inherently irrational as Economics 101 would suggest. Yes, rent control is a bad idea if you’re worried about the long-term prospects for economic efficiency. But maybe the people who advocate these policies know exactly what they’re rooting for, and that’s not it.  The rent control debate can be viewed as a microcosm of the debate about globalization and international trade.'' ``There’s an obligation to think about individual lives. Life isn’t just about money, and jobs aren’t just about income. A sense of stability, of purpose, of social standing — all these things matter in ways that economic models don’t do a very good job of taking into account.''},

% Which concludes:  
% 1.  Tax bills go up, even when the tax rate does not.  
% 2.  Effective tax rates (taxes as a percent of market value) vary among types of property with home owners paying much lower rates than owners of commercial and residential rental property; and, these differentials are far greater than in other cities.  
% 3.  Within each of the major types of property, the effective tax rate paid by owners varies widely in an often inequitable manner.
