  comment={Even though Democrats are doing better in red states like Georgia, it's not by winning over rural voters who still find them too far to the left. It's by winning more of the urban centers in those states. This is true both in the south and the north. In rural areas Trump did BETTER in 2020 than he did in 2016. This defies the idea that some red states are trending towards Democrats. Rural voters are actually being more and more left behind by the Democrats.},

Bloomberg put down 100 million against Trump in Florida, Texas, and Ohio all of which went to Trump.

  comment={A calculation of the probability that any individual's vote will determine the outcome of a presidential election (in a 2008 election environment). ``In a presidential election, the probability that your vote is decisive is equal to the probability that your state is necessary for an electoral college win, times the probability the vote in your state is tied, conditional on your state being necessary.'' They find that there is a 1 in 60 million chance of a randomly selected voter having an impact on the presidential election. In a battleground state it is more like 1 in 10 million. In New York it is about 1 in a billion. They suggest that the argument for voting is could be something like ``it's like you have a chance at winning the lottery of having say over national policy.''

Like plea bargaining where 90% of federal cases are plea bargained (making the question of innocence irrelevant) 90% of immigration cases never have a hearing, people take the "voluntary departure" option in exchange for paying their own way out of the US and not having a record (so they could potentially try to enter again another time).Between 1920 and 2018, the latest year for which data was available, the country deported 56.3 million people, more than the 51.7 million who were granted lawful status. Roughly nine out of ten deportees were Mexican. (Goodman does not include self-deportations in this number, since he acknowledges that they are “unquantifiable.”) In the 1990s Democrats supported "expedited deportation" which made actual deportation more like voluntary departure -- hearings are not longer required.},

While this article is carefully written to not directly pop the bubble of belief that Trump is a new Hitler (if that is something you are holding on to) it carefully walks through what's similar and what's different without attributing Trump with any particular role, of Hitler or otherwise. He finds similarities between the current US and the Weimar period --- particularly in the weakening of the Democratic order. But the most interesting thing is the DIFFERENCE between the Nazis and the US now: it is no longer necessary to eliminate opposition parties. They can be left in place by dictators and used to claim democractic legitimacy. Also control of the press and media is unneccesary because the "truth" of the media is no longer important. Browning calls this "illiberal democracy."},

In doing so the paper integrates the Keynes-Hayek perspective on the importance of ideas with the currently more fashionable Stigler-Becker (interests only) approach to political economy. We distinguish between two kinds of ideational politics – the battle among different worldviews on the efficacy of policy (worldview politics) versus the politics of victimhood, pride and identity (identity politics). Political entrepreneurs discover identity and policy ‘memes’ (narratives, cues, framing) that shift beliefs about how the world works or a person’s belief of who he is (i.e. identity). Our framework identifies a complementarity between worldview politics and identity politics and illustrates how they may reinforce each other. In particular, an increase in identity polarization may be associated with a shift in views about how the world works. Furthermore, an increase in income inequality is likely to result in a greater incidence of ideational politics. Finally, we show how ideas may not just constrain, but also ‘bite’ the interests that helped propagate them in the first instance.},

  year={2018},  
  comment={Kinda meanders around for a while, but eventually gets down to some really interesting points about how the Democratic party is making a huge mistake by avoid self-criticism on what went wrong in 2016. It has some interesting corollary to Edsall's 3-29 piece in the Times. ``It has led the Democrats into a trap familiar to anyone with experience of left-wing politics: the party’s own high regard for itself has come to eclipse every other concern. Among the authorized opinion leaders of liberalism, for example, the task of deploring and denouncing the would-be dictator has crowded out the equally important task of assessing where the Democratic Party went wrong. Indeed, the two projects appear to them to be contradictory --- they find it impossible to flagellate Trump one day and examine themselves the next. Of the two, it is introspection that must hit the bricks. And it is uncompromising moral stridor that has come to dominate the opinion pages and the airwaves of the enlightened --- a continuous outpouring of agony and aghastitude at Trump and his works.  This is unfortunate, because what happened in 2016 deserves to be taken seriously. This country of 320 million people was swept by a tidal wave of populist rage. Alongside the ugly eruption of bigotry there swirled perfectly natural concerns about deindustrialization, oligarchy, the power of big banks, bad trade deals, and the long-term abandonment of working-class concerns by the Democrats.'' ``But most leading Democrats can’t seem to see any of that. They don’t know what to make of Trump and his supporters, so violently does Trumpism transgress the professional norms to which they are accustomed. It is distasteful to them that they should be required to learn anything from a clown like the current president --- that they should have to change in any way to accommodate his preposterous views. And so they cast about for leaders who might allow them to prevail without doing anything differently: a celebrity who might communicate better, a politician who might turn out the base more effectively. They devour articles about Trump voters who have had a change of heart and now beg forgiveness for their sins. They chide other liberals whom they regard as insufficiently enthusiastic about the Democratic Party. Above all, they dream of a deus ex machina, a super-prosecutor who will bring down justice like fire and reverse the unfortunate results of 2016 without anyone having to change their talking points in the slightest.'' ``On the other hand, in the vast catalogue of social posturing, there are few more repugnant sights than rich people congratulating themselves for being righteous. In particular, it is a terrible way to win back the blue-collar white voters who were responsible, even more than were the Russians, for Trump’s win.'' ``For them, there’s an alternative to political victory: a utopia of scolding. Who needs to win elections when you can personally reestablish the rightful social order every day on Twitter and Facebook? When you can scold, and scold, and scold, and scold. That’s their future, and it’s a satisfying one: a finger wagging in some deplorable’s face, forever.''},

Covers basic issues of information security as well. ``The more details that emerged about the reach and sophistication of government surveillance, the more absurd our situation seemed. Some of the most sensitive intelligence information in the world had traveled in plain sight through the U.S. mail, then sat in my hallway, where it could have been pilfered as casually as all those other packages. Thinking about that made my head spin. It also reflected what I consider to be one of the great lessons of adulthood: that most of the institutions and endeavors we regard as ironclad — from parenting to politics — are actually held together with chewing gum and duct tape. Nothing truly works, at least not for long, or not in the way it’s supposed to. This reality is terrifying, because it exposes the precariousness of the existing order. But it’s also liberating, because it encourages the individual to act, to defy the ominous mythology of competence and control.'' ``In a video posted by the Guardian on June 9, 2013, Snowden seemed strangely prescient about what was to come. “There will be a time,” he said, “when policies will change”: The only thing that restricts the activities of the surveillance state are policy. Even our agreements with other sovereign governments. We consider that to be a stipulation of policy rather than a stipulation of law. And because of that, a new leader will be elected. They’ll flip the switch, say that because of the crisis, because of the dangers that we face in the world, you know, some new and unpredicted threat, we need more authority. We need more power. And there will be nothing the people can do at that point to oppose it, and it will be turnkey tyranny.''},

  journal={The New York Times},  
  date={2017-04-11},  
  comment={Through a detailed look at the history of the American right, a historian of conservatism looks back at how he and his peers failed to anticipate the rise of the president because historians undervalued the power of the fringe movements of conservatism. Conservatism was thought to be vanquished by the New Deal at the end of World War II, until William F. Buckley Jr. restarted the movement with the National Review. National Review wanted to express an intelligent conservative viewpoint, a coherent view that eventually became the dominant form of conservatism. Part of this was conservatives denouncing the paranoid fringe. But Trump forced a change to that narrative - he embraced the paranoid fringe. Historians never saw this coming. Richard Hofstadter pushed the idea that there was a "consensus" school of historians; that Americans agreed upon moderate liberalism as the nation's natural governing philosophy. This idea discounted the conservatives of the 1960s as far-right kooks (like Barry Goldwater and Joseph McCarthy). He called them "the paranoid style in American politics". But Reagan's success undermines Hofstadter's notion that conservatism was over. Lisa McGirr wrote a book in 2001 called “Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right” which became a cornerstone of the movement among historians to deal with the right as smart people reacting against liberal permissiveness. But Perlstein argues these historian gave too MUCH credit to the conservatism being a sensible movement and not enough to the crazy fringe. Hofstadter was overly dismissive, and McGirr (and Perlstein) gave conservatives too much credit. Leo Ribuffo comes along and argues that America’s anti-liberal traditions were far more deeply rooted in the past, and far angrier, than most historians would acknowledge. Among the fringe conservative history now recognized as relevant (in the wake of Trump) is the Klan's notion that social democracy should be reserved only for white people and supported public education - to weaken catholic schools. The Klan had a group called the Black Legion with 135,000 people in it in 1936. Humphrey Bogart starred in a movie about it. But most historian had never heard of it. This article also covers Father Charles Coughlin, a radio priest out of Detroit with 30 million listeners who started a magazine called Social Justice. But he started preaching anti-Semitism like Henry Ford and led to support of a pro Hitler rally in 1939 Madison Square Garden where the leader spoke in front of an enormous picture of George Washington flanked by swastikas.},

  comment={About the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech at Riverside Church in Upper Manhattan against the Vietnam War, one year before he was assasssinated. In the final years of his life he rejected the optimism of the "I Have a Dream" speech and instead mourned how it had "turned into a nightmare." He highlighted how civil rights was never a discrete problem in American society, and that racism went hand in hand with the fellow evils of poverty and militarism. He was against the war early, but decided not to denounce the war right away because “Sometimes the public is not ready to digest the truth.” ``Dr. King remained relatively mute about the war through most of 1966, but by year’s end he was expressing private disgust at how increased military spending had torn a gaping budget hole in Johnson’s Great Society domestic programs.'' He got a standing ovation in the church, but the press came out against him. ``The New York Times called Dr. King’s remarks both “facile” and “slander.” It said the moral issues in Vietnam “are less clear-cut than he suggests” and warned that “to divert the energies of the civil rights movement to the Vietnam issue is both wasteful and self-defeating,” given how the movement needed to confront what the paper called “the intractability of slum mores and habits.”'' ``Dr. King was indeed ahead of his time, but not for long. A year later, antiwar sentiment pushed Johnson out of his re-election bid, and today we remember opposition to the war as a widespread phenomenon, so much so that Dr. King’s Riverside Church speech is often overlooked as just one more statement against an unpopular conflict.''},

  comment={Discusses different implications of human inability to reason. ``Humans’ biggest advantage over other species is our ability to coöperate. Coöperation is difficult to establish and almost as difficult to sustain. For any individual, freeloading is always the best course of action. Reason developed not to enable us to solve abstract, logical problems or even to help us draw conclusions from unfamiliar data; rather, it developed to resolve the problems posed by living in collaborative groups.'' ``the task that reason evolved to perform, which is to prevent us from getting screwed by the other members of our group. Living in small bands of hunter-gatherers, our ancestors were primarily concerned with their social standing, and with making sure that they weren’t the ones risking their lives on the hunt while others loafed around in the cave. There was little advantage in reasoning clearly, while much was to be gained from winning arguments.'' Also covers the illusion of explanatory depth: ``People believe that they know way more than they actually do. What allows us to persist in this belief is other people. In the case of my toilet, someone else designed it so that I can operate it easily. This is something humans are very good at. We’ve been relying on one another’s expertise ever since we figured out how to hunt together, which was probably a key development in our evolutionary history. So well do we collaborate, Sloman and Fernbach argue, that we can hardly tell where our own understanding ends and others’ begins.'' ``Where it gets us into trouble, according to Sloman and Fernbach, is in the political domain...“As a rule, strong feelings about issues do not emerge from deep understanding,” Sloman and Fernbach write. And here our dependence on other minds reinforces the problem. If your position on, say, the Affordable Care Act is baseless and I rely on it, then my opinion is also baseless. When I talk to Tom and he decides he agrees with me, his opinion is also baseless, but now that the three of us concur we feel that much more smug about our views. If we all now dismiss as unconvincing any information that contradicts our opinion, you get, well, the Trump Administration.'' ``If we—or our friends or the pundits on CNN—spent less time pontificating and more trying to work through the implications of policy proposals, we’d realize how clueless we are and moderate our views. This, they write, “may be the only form of thinking that will shatter the illusion of explanatory depth and change people’s attitudes.”'' ``Providing people with accurate information doesn’t seem to help; they simply discount it. Appealing to their emotions may work better, but doing so is obviously antithetical to the goal of promoting sound science. “The challenge that remains,” they write toward the end of their book, “is to figure out how to address the tendencies that lead to false scientific belief.”''},

  comment={Discusses the fact that the US is polarized based on type of place: urban vs rural, and the differences aren't about a single issue, but pretty much everything. Raises the question: if richer more centrist liberals are moving into cities, will the cities become more centrist in politics than their traditional left-wing working class? ``There’s a shift that’s been happening over the past 10 or 15 years, where the more conservative upper middle class is moving from the suburbs into urban areas, which have for a long time been bastions of a more liberal working class. How is that changing cities?  Lily Geismer: A lot of it has to do with how you define liberal and conservative. Oftentimes there's this affluent group of people who have come in, who are quite liberal on social issues, and are liberal about issues on the national level. But what I tracked in my research is the closer you got to people’s property values, their tax rates, and their children’s educations, they became less collective-minded or less progressive, which is sort of more conservative in their values.'' Also a nice thought about public-private partnerships: ``There always was a place for the private sector and this idea of public-private partnerships. That was at the heart of things like urban renewal in the 1950s and 1960s. But there’s a difference—the New Deal was about stimulating those sectors and working in partnership, and this is letting the private sector do a lot, if not most, of the work. And that shift occurred in the 1970s, in response to a recession and the rise of inflation. There was pushback against Keynesian economic models that led to this notion that the private sector is a more effective way of getting things done. There’s also a lot of pushback against large government bureaucracy that emerges during that time, this idea that it’s better and more efficient if it comes from the private sector.''},

% One of the huge unspoken problems is that neither the left or the right actually wants to do ALL the things necessary to achieve the outcomes that come from their values.  
% For instance, if the liberals actually want to increase social safety net programs, they HAVE to address the more than a billions dollars a day we spend on defense.  
Why do we spend so much on defence? Because we have a military presense across the world.  
% If we reduce that military presense significantly, we reduce our global influence significantly. If we reduce our global influence, we reduce the resources we have for social safety nets.  
% Or conservatives might want to cut down the government, and keep the military at home. But that would mean cutting back our miltary, and our global influence too.  
% Without that global influence, we won't be able to keep global corporations, a group conservatives are very committed to.  
% The truth is, if we want to become an isolationist, independent country, if we want to not be responsible for the rest of the world, if we want to take care of our own, the whole system has to change. Burn the whole thing down.  
% And it will come with an economic haircut for the middle class and the wealthy, (assuming your are willing to build the social safety net for the poor.)  
% There is no way to keep what we have now and at the same time change things for the values of the right or the left.  
% It's like a political version of intersectionality - there's no way to move forward without considering all the different influences. Interestingly, there's no way to move forward without causing pain to some of those influences. (That might be true of intersectionality in general.)  
% Sadly no liberal with that agenda has ever made it into power. Even more sadly, an insane right-wing demagogue HAS made it into just such a position of power.  
% There is of course the middle-ground policy-tweaking of the Obama administration - where people in power try to keep everyone happy while squeezing out some small benefits for the poor.  
% This, by definition, requires not cutting benefits to most people.  
% This also, clearly, does not work. There is no way for the US to reduce its insane carbon output without cutting back on consumer goods, global trade, and global influence. That won't happen without cutting down our global military presense. If it does happen, the middle class (and the rich) will be generally far worse off than it is now.

This article also defines sanctuary cities - non-sanctuary cities give information they have to ICE after someone has been held for 48 hours. Sanctuary cities will only do it under court order.

We show that adding the assumption that people are worse off when they experience low income as a result of leader betrayal (than when it is the result of bad luck) to a simple voter choice model yields a preference for incompetent leaders. These deliver worse material outcomes in general, but they reduce the feelings of betrayal during bad times. We find some evidence consistent with our model in a survey carried out on the eve of the recent U.S. presidential election.  Priming survey participants with questions about the importance of competence in policymaking usually reduced their support for the candidate who was perceived as less competent; this effect was reversed for rural, and less educated white, survey participants.},

  comment={Looking at the data on the election shows that Clinton did not lose because of a turnout problem, but because lower-income working-class white voters of the North who voted for Obama in the last election, voted for Trump in this one. The Clinton administration knew this was a problem. ``Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump ran against the establishment — and against a candidate who embodied it far more than John McCain or Mr. Romney did. The various allegations against Mrs. Clinton neatly complemented the notion that she wasn’t out to help ordinary Americans.'' There was also a large decline in black voter turnout - likely because there was just less interest in voting for a white person at the top of the ticket. Note that decline was similar across the country, regarldess of new laws that might reduce turnout. If black turnout had matches 2012 levels Clinton probably would have won. However, Obama could have won even with low black turnout. Also: ``Mrs. Clinton’s gains were concentrated among the most affluent and best-educated white voters, much as Mr. Trump’s gains were concentrated among the lowest-income and least-educated white voters.''},

  comment={Researches from Harvard who claim that Trump tests positive as an anti-democratic politician. Points out that democracy depends on politicians adhereing to a bunch of unstated traditions and guidelines: ``Democratic institutions must be reinforced by strong informal norms. Like a pickup basketball game without a referee, democracies work best when unwritten rules of the game, known and respected by all players, ensure a minimum of civility and cooperation. Norms serve as the soft guardrails of democracy, preventing political competition from spiraling into a chaotic, no-holds-barred conflict. Among the unwritten rules that have sustained American democracy are partisan self-restraint and fair play. For much of our history, leaders of both parties resisted the temptation to use their temporary control of institutions to maximum partisan advantage, effectively underutilizing the power conferred by those institutions. There existed a shared understanding, for example, that anti-majoritarian practices like the Senate filibuster would be used sparingly, that the Senate would defer (within reason) to the president in nominating Supreme Court justices, and that votes of extraordinary importance — like impeachment — required a bipartisan consensus. Such practices helped to avoid a descent into the kind of partisan fight to the death that destroyed many European democracies in the 1930s.''},

  journal={The New Yorker},  
  date={2016-11-07},  
  comment={Review of books arguing against systems of popular democracy and for some kind of modified representative system.  Describes David Estlund's defense of democracy, which ends up resting on the argument ``that universal suffrage is so established in our minds as a default that giving the knowledgeable power over the ignorant will always feel more unjust than giving those in the majority power over those in the minority.'' Describes Jason Brennan's argument that ``American voters have remained ignorant despite decades of rising education levels. Some economists have argued that ill-informed voters, far from being lazy or self-sabotaging, should be seen as rational actors. If the odds that your vote will be decisive are minuscule---Brennan writes that `you are more likely to win Powerball a few times in a row'---then learning about politics isn’t worth even a few minutes of your time.'' And, ``He was equally unimpressed by the argument that it’s one’s duty to vote. `It would be bad if no one farmed,' he wrote, `but that does not imply that everyone should farm.' In fact, he suspected, the imperative to vote might be even weaker than the imperative to farm. After all, by not voting you do your neighbor a good turn. `If I do not vote, your vote counts more,' Brennan wrote.'' Brennan splits voters into groups: ``Brennan calls people who don’t bother to learn about politics hobbits, and he thinks it for the best if they stay home on Election Day. A second group of people enjoy political news as a recreation, following it with the partisan devotion of sports fans, and Brennan calls them hooligans. Third in his bestiary are vulcans, who investigate politics with scientific objectivity, respect opposing points of view, and carefully adjust their opinions to the facts, which they seek out diligently. It’s vulcans, presumably, who Brennan hopes will someday rule over us, but he doesn’t present compelling evidence that they really exist. In fact, one study he cites shows that even people with excellent math skills tend not to draw on them if doing so risks undermining a cherished political belief. This shouldn’t come as a surprise. In recent memory, sophisticated experts have been confident about many proposals that turned out to be disastrous---invading Iraq, having a single European currency, grinding subprime mortgages into the sausage known as collateralized debt obligations, and so on.'' But Brennan doesn't really offer any kind of viable alternative or method for selecting vulcans. Some other references are referred to as well: ``In `The Myth of the Rational Voter' (2007), the economist Bryan Caplan suggested that ignorance may even be gratifying to voters. `Some beliefs are more emotionally appealing,' Caplan observed, so if your vote isn’t likely to do anything why not indulge yourself in what you want to believe, whether or not it’s true? Caplan argues that it’s only because of the worthlessness of an individual vote that so many voters look beyond their narrow self-interest: in the polling booth, the warm, fuzzy feeling of altruism can be had cheap.'' The author wraps up by comparing voting to combat: ``But maybe voting is neither commons nor market. Perhaps, instead, it’s combat. Relatively gentle, of course.  Rather than rifles and bayonets, essentially there’s just a show of hands. But the nature of the duty may be similar, because what Brennan’s model omits is that sometimes, in an election, democracy itself is in danger. If a soldier were to calculate his personal value to the campaign that his army is engaged in, he could easily conclude that the cost of showing up at the front isn’t worth it, even if he factors in the chance of being caught and punished for desertion. The trouble is that it’s impossible to know in advance of a battle which side will prevail, let alone by how great a margin, especially if morale itself is a variable. The lack of certainty about the future makes a hash of merely prudential calculation. It’s said that most soldiers worry more about letting down the fellow-soldiers in their unit than about allegiance to an entity as abstract as the nation, and maybe voters, too, feel their duty most acutely toward friends and family who share their idea of where the country needs to go.''},

Professor Blau said economists had found many reasons that young people who drop out of high school struggle to find work. “There is no indication immigration is the major factor,” she said.'' ``High-skilled immigrants, especially in technology and science, who have come in larger numbers in recent years, had a significant “positive impact” on Americans with skills, and also on working-class Americans.

If you spin a roulette wheel, or even send a baseball team out on the field to face an opponent, there are a set range of things that can happen, and it’s relatively straightforward to figure out the probability of each.

Judges selected by non-partisan elections write higher-quality opinions than judges selected by partisan elections. Judges selected by technocratic merit commissions write higher-quality opinions than either partisan-elected judges or non-partisan-elected judges. Election-year politics reduces judicial performance in both partisan and non-partisan election systems. Giving stronger tenure to non-partisan-selected judges improves performance, while giving stronger tenure to partisan-selected judges has no effect. These results are consistent with the view that technocratic merit commissions have better information about the quality of candidates than voters, and that political bias can reduce the quality of elected officials.},

Also consistent with the predictions of our model, the drop-off in ratings for private channels with moderate ideology takes an intermediate value. In addition, the drop-off is stronger for viewers with access to cable channels, which are not required to air cadenas. Consistent with this result, we also show that viewership of an opposition cable channel rises during cadenas. Complementing this analysis, we then estimate the parameters of the theoretical model in a structural analysis. Using these parameter estimates, we consider counterfactual scenarios, allowing for an examination of the dynamic responses of viewers of differing ideology to cadenas and an analysis of the welfare consequences of cadenas.},

  comment = {An in-depth article about the reality of gun-violence and politics in America. ``In 2009, the gun homicide rate for white Americans was 2 per 100,000 — about seven times as high as the rate for residents of Denmark, but a fraction of the rate for black Americans. In 2009, black Americans faced a gun homicide rate of nearly 15 per 100,000. That’s higher than the gun homicide rate in Mexico.'' ``Even in high-crime cities, the risk of gun violence is mostly concentrated among a small number of men. In Oakland, for instance, crime experts working with the police department a few years ago found that about 1,000 active members of a few dozen street groups drove most homicides. That’s .3 percent of Oakland’s population. And even within this subgroup, risk fluctuated according to feuds and other beefs. In practical terms, the experts found that over a given stretch of several months only about 50 to 100 men are at the highest risk of shooting someone or getting shot.'' Includes an account of how Boston dramatically lowered gun deaths by working with the community of men most at risk to change the dynamics and offer them protection if someone is shot, called Operation Ceasefire, or more technically ``focussed deterrence''. ``Part of what seems to make Ceasefire effective is that it treats the men it targets as both dangerous and also in need of help. Such initiatives, however, fit into no political camp and thus have few powerful champions.  “It has no natural constituency,” said Thomas Abt, a Harvard Kennedy School researcher who has worked on crime policy at the Justice Department. “To vastly oversimplify, progressives want more prevention and conservatives want more enforcement.

In its simplest form, the problem reflects the use of externally invalid measures of the dynamics that generate cultural conflict over risk and other policy-relevant facts. But at a more fundamental level, the science-of-science-communication measurement problem inheres in the phenomena being measured themselves. The “beliefs” individuals form about a societal risk such as climate change are not of a piece; rather they reflect the distinct clusters of inferences that individuals draw as they engage information for two distinct ends: to gain access to the collective knowledge furnished by science, and to enjoy the sense of identity enabled by membership in a community defined by particular cultural commitments. The paper shows how appropriately designed “science comprehension” tests — one general, and one specific to climate change — can be used to measure individuals’ reasoning proficiency as collective-knowledge acquirers independently of their reasoning proficiency as cultural-identity protectors. Doing so reveals that there is in fact little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens on what science knows about climate change. The source of the climate-change controversy and like disputes is the contamination of education and politics with forms of cultural status competition that make it impossible for diverse citizens to express their reason as both collective-knowledge acquirers and cultural-identity protectors at the same time.},

While many indicators of survey quality have steadily declined in recent decades, the literature has largely emphasized rising nonresponse rates rather than other potentially more important dimensions to the problem. We divide the problem into rising rates of nonresponse, imputation, and measurement error, documenting the rise in each of these threats to survey quality over the past three decades.  A fundamental problem in assessing biases due to these problems in surveys is the lack of a benchmark or measure of truth, leading us to focus on the accuracy of the reporting of government transfers. We provide evidence from aggregate measures of transfer reporting as well as linked microdata. We discuss the relative importance of misreporting of program receipt and conditional amounts of benefits received, as well as some of the conjectured reasons for declining cooperation and survey errors. We end by discussing ways to reduce the impact of the problem including the increased use of administrative data and the possibilities for combining administrative and survey data.},

On non-lethal uses of force, blacks and Hispanics are more than fifty percent more likely to experience some form of force in interactions with police. Adding controls that account for important context and civilian behavior reduces, but cannot fully explain, these disparities. On the most extreme use of force – officer-involved shootings – we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account. We argue that the patterns in the data are consistent with a model in which police officers are utility maximizers, a fraction of which have a preference for discrimination, who incur relatively high expected costs of officer-involved shootings.},

Black and white civilians involved in police shootings were equally likely to have been carrying a weapon.'' And, in Houston, in tense shoot-or-don't-shoot situations, Fryer found that cops were about 20\% less likely to shoot if the suspect was black. However, lethal use of force is very rare. Fryer also found that excessive use of every day force, like drawing a weapon, shoving someone against a wall, or putting hands on someone is far more common for black people than white people. ``“Who the hell wants to have a police officer put their hand on them or yell and scream at them? It’s an awful experience,” he said. “I’ve had it multiple, multiple times. Every black man I know has had this experience. Every one of them. It is hard to believe that the world is your oyster if the police can rough you up without punishment. And when I talked to minority youth, almost every single one of them mentions lower level uses of force as the reason why they believe the world is corrupt.”''},
