	* In the cold-war era, geopoitics and ideology were the forces that top experts dealt with.
	* In the post-cold war era, those faded and people looked to economists as the top experts
	* But 2008 proved them wrong. Krugman says “Economists had mistaken beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth.”
		*  In other words, they’d fallen in love with the supposed rigor that derives from the assumption that markets function perfectly. But the world had turned out to be more complex and unpredictable than the equations.

* https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/science/weather-predictions-forecasts.html
	* Despite the optimistic title to this article, it's really saying just that they will be able to predict _tropical_ region weather a little further out, and only because that weather is much simpler.
	* Scientists today call this roadblock the predictability horizon, a point of no return for weather forecasting. Anything beyond it is not much better than a random guess.  “Science has painted a fence around what it can do in a very spectacular way,” said Dr. Emanuel, who worked alongside Dr. Lorenz for more than three decades. No matter how much data you have or how powerful your computers are, he said, eventually your ability to improve “slows down and grinds to a halt.”
* https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/us/politics/diplomat-attacks-havana-syndrome.html
	* As Alan Moore said: the news is a process of looking at all the random crap and making up a story to fit it.

	* "The sheer complexity of Trump’s finances — the numerous partnerships, limited-liability corporations and shell companies through which he does business — would make it difficult to build a case that a jury could follow."

	* The Trump poison went deeper than anyone knew (in many ways, despite the finally overwhelming turnout for Biden, he won by the skin of his teeth. A slightly bad day for him and it would have gone to Trump.)
	* The defund-the-police movement hurt Democrats
* https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/technology/deepmind-ai-protein-folding.html
	* DeepMind, a lab owned by the same parent company as Google, said on Monday that its system, called AlphaFold, had solved what is known as “the protein folding problem.” Given the string of amino acids that make up a protein, the system can rapidly and reliably predict its three-dimensional shape.
	* The exception that proves the rule: we are entering into that long-predicted-by-sci-fi era where the machines are smarter than we are. The 'experts' themselves don't know how it works, just that it does.
		* we are now entering a period where we are up against the limits of human understanding (and maybe physical abilities too --- limits in sports and all)
		* Sci-fi saw this coming half a century ago, but our _culture_ remains entirely organized around the authority of 'experts.'
		* We will very soon need to come to terms with the fact that there are severe limitations on what experts understand, or are even capable of understanding.
			* (Not that there's _no_ room for experts, they are very useful people! But we treat them now as if they are infallible, when the reality is GOOD experts know they only know a bit more than the layman, and there's a wide range of stuff they don't/can't know. We should make that perspective of experts the forefront, and encourage/enforce that attitude when consulting them.)
		* And we need to come to terms that we will have to hand off a lot of 'expertise' to AIs --- and they will become the sources that (maybe) seem infallible, and like our experts today, cannot even explain to use why they know what they know.

	* The Democrats want to investigate what went wrong in 2020.
	* The last time a party did this was in 2012, the Republicans investigated what went wrong that year. They came to the conclusion that they should move more centrist, and adpot immigration reform.
	* Instead they threw that out, and later nominated Trump.

* https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/business/ship-suez-canal.html
	* Experts pushed globalized shipping and manufacturing for the last few decades. To our peril.
	* I also note that in many places people cite how many ships move through the Suez without incident each year. That this kind of thing has never happened before. But this sense of stats is not like air travel where you can reassure yourself that _your_ chances of being in an airline crash are vitually nil based on how many airplanes travel each day. Rather it's the other way around: the more ships pass through the canal and the more time passes without incident, the more LIKELY it is that there would be some incident or disaster that could block the canal.
* https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/the-curious-case-of-floridas-pandemic-response/618360/
	* This article is more about how Florida always proves 'national narratives' wrong --- so in this case it's _which_ experts you choose to trust: the rich media and political classes and what they say about the state, or the statisticians that are continually proving them wrong? Also, he ends with the point that despite all that, Florida was predicted to be devastated by the virus and has come though with just about average results. Nobody knows why.

* ttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/22/science/flu-season-coronavirus-pandemic.html
	* 2k flu cases in 2020-2021 flu season vs 200k+ normally
	* so, virtually _nobody_ died of the flu this year.
	* That's something like roughly 30k lives saved.
	* So either the flu shot is nearly useless compared to whatever we are doing during corona virus, or all the people who would have died of the flu died of covid instead.
	* Does this not suggest that it is morally incumbent on us to follow the anti-covid procedures that worked... and maybe skip the flu shot that doesn't really work?

* https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/opinion/salt-deduction-democrats.html
	* NY Democrats are holding up the infrastructure bill because they WANT a tax BREAK for the VERY rich. 
	* And that is a REPEAL of a CAP to the SALT break that REPUBLICANS put in place (because it much more strongly affected rich people in blue states than red)
	* Because the SALT tax break particularly benefits rich people in NY.
	* The Time Editorial Board admits here that they supported this tax break in the past --- basically buying into trickle-down economics when it came to their own personal finances. But now they are paying more attention to inequality, they say. And so call for a repeal of the tax break entirely. (Though man do they seem reluctant to reach that conclusion.)

* https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/briefing/outdoor-covid-transmission-cdc-number.html
	* the scientific evidence points to a conclusion that is much simpler than the C.D.C.’s message: Masks make a huge difference indoors and rarely matter outdoors. 
	* There is not a single documented Covid infection anywhere in the world from casual outdoor interactions, such as walking past someone on a street or eating at a nearby table.

* https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/
	* The CDC and WHO and other health authorities for decades subscribed to and promoted the idea that particles of 5 microns or more sank to the ground. It turns out, through historical research, that this was based on an incorrect heursitic applied over and over again through the decades. The initial belief was based on a conflation of experimental results in the 1950s.
	* The reluctance to question or believe that particles up to 100 microns float in air and cause infection was based on the foundational belief that "bad air" or miasma was an old-fashioned notion, and modern science believes in hand-washing, cleanliness, and that disease is spread mostly through contact of droplets.
	* My reading of this is that hand-washing is WAY overblown
	* And it blows my mind that in this case the intuitive idea that "bad air" makes you sick --- and a mask might help --- was completely downplayed by "experts" for _decades_. And turned out to be almost entirely right.

* https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/opinion/europe-vaccines-commission.html
	* The EU not only can't deliver vaccines, it (and it's currency) hardly ever work to the benefit of its constituents.

* Y2K: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem#Opposing_view
	* Clearly Y2K was a HUGE waste of money
	* Driven by surprising factors:
		* A "sexy" problem that was easily explained, and could result in immediate apocalypse
		* "Experts" who latched on to the problem and helped spread the word of it
		* "Experts" who gleaned the profits of all the "work" that went into fixing systems.
	* The thing about the 'supporting arguments' is that it's provable -- good research could CLEARLY show if this was a waste of money or not. This is _computers_ we're talking about here, not social science. There are clear answers that are there to be had.
		* The fact that nobody (apparently) has done this research STRONGLY supports the opposing view -- the experts don't WANT to know the answer.
		* It might be expensive to do this research, but we're talking about HUNDREDS of billions of dollars wasted. Seems like SOMEONE would want to know where the money actually went -- if it weren't going to embarass a bunch of the industry's own "experts"

* Neo-liberalism and globalism completely failed in all it's stated goals:
	* https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/17/opinion/neoliberalism-economy.html

* New research suggests that research from 1979 that suggested depressed people had a more accurate view of the world ("sadder but wiser") might be incorrect.
	* https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/health/depressive-realism-theory.html 
	* The original research was VERY influential both with researchers and the general public.
	* The doubts are Strongly disputed by original researchers.

* Finds continue to challenge the notion that humans evolved entirely in Africa:
	* More and more it seems that human ancestors spent millions of years in Europe before returning to Africa 
	* Which is great. But the "wholly out of Africa" crew (and their scientific egos) are up to dirty tricks to try to keep their concept at the forefront
	* https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2021/11/04/ancient-bones-out-of-savannastan/

* Chinese Medicine has proven effective in combating covid:
	* https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2021/11/04/traditional-chinese-medicine-covid-wards/
	* This article is much more complex than that though. TCM is actually a sterilized branding of Chinese Medicine, intended to modernize it by the Chinese Communist Part and let it compete with Western "biomedicine". Instead it exist alongside biomedicine in China as a kind of palliative thing.
	* But the Communist Party is now supporting reconnecting to ancient Chinese culture, and some practitioners (those who remember it from before the Communist party) are trying to make the case that a more serious version of Chinese Medicine connected to it's thousand-years heritage, is effective in fighting modern disease.
		* These folks want to call this more serious/complex version "Classic Chinese Medicine"
	* To prove it, the primary proponent, who wrote an influential book about it 20 years ago, went to Wuhan to treat covid.
	* The Chinese government has implemented Chinese Medicine alongside biomedicine in treating covid -- and in those places had significantly lower fatalities from covid.
		* (Though the data is, of course, disputed)
	* The NY Times of course basically mocked the effort to treat covid with Chinese Medicine.
* Scientists manipulate images:
	* https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/29/opinion/science-fraud-image-manipulation-photoshop.html
	* (See article in bib on colorising JWST -- manipulating images, but not necessarily bad)
* Secondhand smoke isn't that bad:
	* https://slate.com/technology/2017/02/secondhand-smoke-isnt-as-bad-as-we-thought.html
	* Added to bib
* Wasn't it just a few weeks ago that the Times was running all these op-eds pushing everyone to get the most recent bivalent shot?
	* https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/18/health/covid-boosters-surge.html 
* 4 times as many people are killed by knives as are killed with rifles:
	* https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-11.xls
	* (Nearly all gun violence is committed with handguns -- 7x as many murders as with knives.)
* [polling articles moves to broken polling and scientific progress germs]
* https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/05/technology/personaltech/lastpass-breach-password-safety.html
	* LastPass, the password manager recommended by security experts for years, has a major data breach.
* https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/14/opinion/biden-trump-classified-documents.html
	* Secret documents being found in unsecured places is not a function of neglect or stupidity, but of the runaway generation of secrets by the Executive branch. So many secrets are generated that there's no way to keep control over them.
	* Once again, Trump is just the *worst* actor in a broken system. The Times and the liberal establishment hate Trump so much, but is that really less about him being awful, and more about the fact that through his awfulness he keeps tipping in the hand that shows the whole system is corrupt to the core? Maybe that's what the establishment is so afraid of really with Trump: that he's going to expose how broken everything is, not through some kind of drain-the-swamp action, but by sheer blatant corruption and wrongdoing that somehow remains JUST this side of legal because the systems are so broken.
* https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/14/business/dealbook/how-common-is-corporate-fraud.html
	* possibly 1/3 of corporations are committing fraud.
	* it is very difficult to prove because people committing fraud often see what they are doing as not illegal, just boundary-pushing (see Trump)
	* Executives lie to themselves about their intent to commit fraud, and intent has to be proven to prosecute. So like at Enron the executives though accounting was bad and they are good. (The article points out that it takes a village to commit fraud. But doesn't mention that you can see how if  the _culture_ of an organization is that accounting is bad or whatever premise of good practices has gone out the window, it's almost impossible to stop fraud once it gets going.)
* https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/17/opinion/dei-trainings-effective.html 
	* Diversity Equity and Inlusion trainings, particularly mandatory ones, are not backed by empirical evidence as being effective, and may do more harm that good.
	* Though keep an eye on the (white) author. He's liberal, but apparently likes to kick hornets nests:
		* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Singal
* https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/23/magazine/cal-newport-interview.html
	* A professor named Peter Sassone in the late ’80s and early ’90s took a collection of major companies that were bringing computers to the front office and followed them through this transition. These computers made certain activities easier, like typing, so they fired a bunch of support staff, because we don’t need typists, we don’t need secretaries. At first, salary expenses went down. But now that the workers who were being supported had to do all this on their own, their productivity went down. So they had to hire more workers to get the same things done, but their salaries were higher than the support staff they fired.

* Hormone replacement therapy for women with menopause troubles works just fine, but had its reputation ruined by a single study:
	* https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/magazine/menopause-hot-flashes-hormone-therapy.html
* Grinding teeth is not actually a problem, cannot be determined by tooth wear, and might actually be good for you (particularly if you have sleep apnea.) Bad teeth grinding is caused by stress-related inducers and can't really be prevented, but must have the inducers treated rather than the grinding:
	* https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/well/live/tooth-grinding-night-guards.html
* Scientist published a photo of a toy and claimed it was a goblin shark in the Mediterranean
	* https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/science/goblin-shark-plastic-toy.html 
	* While this is funny, and anyone can make a mistake, and there's nothing wrong with the scientists themselves being either idiots or trying to pull a fast one for the sake of rep; the real problem here is the actual scientific REVIEW process failed -- nothing wrong with this paper being submitted, scientifically, it's that it got published that's a telltale of how broken peer review is. And the article ends with the note that this is likely to happen again.

	* Things we should have known about covid: immune systems _need_ many exposures to viruses. (Shingles is on the rise in adults because the chicken pox vaccine is making it so people are not being regularly exposed to chicken pox anymore. We used to think you just needed on big exposure to chicken pox and you were set for life. But now we know that you actually need to be exposed to chicken pox hundreds of times, and repeatedly forever to stay immune.)
	* In terms of the idea the one exposure to covid would create immunity (also false, and virologists knew that): "The short answer is that epidemiologists are not immunologists and immunologists are not virologists and virologists are not epidemiologists. And, in general, physicians don’t know anything about the details. And the world has never before been forced to so directly grapple with these nuances."
* https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/health/hernia-surgery-component-separation.html
	* Doctors are teaching themselves surgery with social media videos
	* I love this line "Dr. Dickens had grown up playing video games and was immediately comfortable at the da Vinci’s remote controls." So much for the old Farside joke about the future of video gamers.
	* (not covered in this article) One of thie biggest problems with our medical system is that it relies on doctors to resist economic pressures and temptations and keep their focus on the best outcomes for the patients. Thus, the "RVU" system of compensation from Medicare. Because the system is set up to trust doctors, it also lets _everyone_ else in the system off the hook, from politicians to the insurance companies, free to pursue money because supposedly the doctors will keep the system in line. But doctors are of the wealth class. They buy expensive cars and houses and educations for their kids, and then have to pay the bills on those. The tempatation to make cash must be overwhelming, and they _are_ the guardrails on the system, they are given power, and there is no system in place to question their decisions.

	* It's possible as a culture we already have the mechanisms in place to prevent deepfakes from contaminating real information. (Those being: skepticism, reliance on social confirmation, and common sense). Which, I would like to point out, was _precisely_ my intuitive sense when people started whining about deepfakes years ago (though I did not express it as eloquently as this article does -- largely because there was no evidence to draw from yet, I think).
	* The real threat might be all the media that can simply be created even though it is KNOWN to be fake: like Biden wagging his tongue. Everyone knows it's fake, but it spurs Trump's base.

	* To this day, this seems like the single biggest mistake the medical fields made around covid, not the conflicting advice on masking or vaccines. Experts should have known BEFORE the pandemic, from _decades_ of existing research, that the virus was airborne. The fact that they didn't was sheer incompetency and ignorance on the part of the top people in public health. THIS is what should be studied: how was the actual evidence for how virus spread simply ignored by people who are _responsible_ for stay current on evidentiary-based policies? That's a social question that is at the HEART of what went wrong with the coronavirus, and as far as I know nobody is researching it or trying to change the culture that led to that.

	* Like most amyloid skeptics, Dr. Schrag agrees that amyloid-beta proteins play a role in the complex mystery of Alzheimer’s, but they’re not the singular key to a cure that so many scientists imagine. If there was a universal source for Alzheimer’s it would show up earlier in life, and be more evident in everyone who suffers from the disease. 
	* “There is an entrenched echo chamber that involves a lot of big names,” Dr. Schrag said. “It’s time for the field to move on.”

	* Includes a pithy description near the beginning of just how fucked up it is that journals don't have to PAY anyone for the work they publish.
* The entire body of research that initially suggested moderate drinking was good for you was based an entire field of research suffering from the same fundamental error:
	* https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/15/magazine/alcohol-health-risks.html
    * To start, they included ex-drinkers in the category of “abstainers,” which meant [scientists] were failing to account for the possibility that some people had stopped drinking specifically because of illness. The moderate drinkers looked healthy by comparison, creating the illusion that a moderate amount of alcohol was beneficial."
	* Though this article is actually about how light drinking has risk, but is actually pretty low.
	* "his phrasing lacked context; it seems loaded with the intent of shaping behavior rather than fully informing people about how to understand that risk." --- this seems like everything that's wrong with public health in one sentence.

* https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/opinion/alzheimers-fraud-cure.html
    * Fraud in research has eaten at the core science of understanindg Alszheimer's.
    * "For decades, Alzheimer’s research has been shaped by the dominance of a single theory, the amyloid hypothesis. It holds that amyloid proteins prompt a cascade of biochemical changes in the brain that cause dementia. The supremacy of that hypothesis has exerted enormous pressure toward scientific conformity."
    * "The entrenchment of the amyloid hypothesis has fostered a kind of groupthink where grants, corporate riches, career advancement and professional reputations often depend on a central idea largely accepted by institutional authorities on faith."
    * "It’s easier to publish dubious science that aligns with conventional wisdom."
    * The last section takes some even-handedness, pointing out that some researchers accused of fraud have also produced good research, and talks about larger-scale issues in science in general. It's a really good piece.
