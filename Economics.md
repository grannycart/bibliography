% "As a result, heterodox economists continue to be treated as just a step or two  
% away from crackpots, despite the fact that they often have a much better record  
% of predicting real-world economic events. What’s more, the basic psychological  
% assumptions on which mainstream (neoclassical) economics is based—though they  
% have long since been disproved by actual psychologists—have colonized the rest  
% of the academy, and have had a profound impact on popular understandings of the  
% world."  
% "To this day, economics continues to be taught not as a story of arguments—not,  
% like any other social science, as a welter of often warring theoretical  
% perspectives—but rather as something more like physics, the gradual  
% realization of universal, unimpeachable mathematical truths."  
% "Only a minority—mostly heterodox economists, post-Keynesians, and modern money  
% theorists—uphold what is called the “credit creation theory of banking”: that  
% bankers simply wave a magic wand and make the money appear, secure in the  
% confidence that even if they hand a client a credit for $1 million, ultimately  
% the recipient will put it back in the bank again, so that, across the system as  
% a whole, credits and debts will cancel out. Rather than loans being based in  
% deposits, in this view, deposits themselves were the result of loans. The one  
% thing it never seemed to occur to anyone to do was to get a job at a bank, and  
% find out what actually happens when someone asks to borrow money. In 2014 a  
% German economist named Richard Werner did exactly that, and discovered that, in  
% fact, loan officers do not check their existing funds, reserves, or anything  
% else. They simply create money out of thin air, or, as he preferred to put it,  
% “fairy dust.”"  
% The idea that money is based on something tangible -- like gold or silver -- is  
% called the Quantitative Theory of Money (QTM) and is based on simplistic ideas  
% of supply and demand (hard money). It arose from the European empires  
% extracting so much in precious metals from their colonies. Before those  
% empires, money in Europe was mostly done on credit. In fact even AFTER the  
% colonies gave everyone the idea that money was based on gold, most of that gold  
% actually resided elsewhere in the world, and back in Europe money was still  
% credit. The QTM theory is fundamentally wrong, but proponents of it continually  
% won debates about how money works -- for centuries.

A UBI would direct much larger shares of transfers to childless, non-elderly, non-disabled households than existing programs, and much more to middle-income rather than poor households. A UBI large enough to increase transfers to low-income families would be enormously expensive. We review the labor supply literature for evidence on the likely impacts of a UBI. We argue that the ongoing UBI pilot studies will do little to resolve the major outstanding questions.},

Institutional investors own 70 percent of the stock market today; while they owned 7 percent in 1950. ``If you count them as a single investor, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are the largest owner of 88 percent of the companies in the Standard \& Poor’s 500.''

  comment={When men and women finish school and start working, they’re paid pretty much equally. The pay gap between genders widens as people age, spreading most sharply in their late 20s to mid 30s --- when many women have children. Unmarried women without children continue to earn closer to what men do. Even married women without children earn less, research shows, because women are more likely to give up job opportunities to either move or stay put for their husband’s job. Married women might also take less intensive jobs in preparation for children, or employers might not give them more responsibility because they assume they’ll have babies and take time off. Couples typically decide that the person who earns less should stay home and take care of the house. But that often ends up being the woman because she earns less because it is assumed she will end up staying home to take care of a household.

  comment={Wealthy people tend to share less of what they have with others. Possibly because money allows people to achieve their goals without depending on others, so it cultivates a mind-set of self-sufficiency that is at odds with charity. Poorer people are quicker to turn to their friends and family for help (with anything: moving, money, cleaning, whatever) while rich people will just hire someone. For this reason wealthy people teach their children to prioritize individuality, while poorer people focus on the needs of the group. Research suggests that taking this into account, it is easier to get rich people to donate to charity by catering to their sense of themselves. Meaning: ask wealthy people to "take individual action" rather than "contribute to the goals of the group." The researchers point out that we often want to change people to do things for the right reason, but really we just need them to do the right thing.},

Offshore is an idea: a parallel legal system for corporations, kleptocrats, celebrities or anyone else who can afford it. Offshore gives the wealthy a way to avoid taxes and regulations and to obscure their identities, thus undermining the ability of governments to keep them in check.'' After World War II the international financial system specifically protected against this kind of thing. But bankers in London in 1963 created the ``Eurobond'' which was not tied to any country, inventing ``offshoring''. ``Offshore often happens right at home. The laws in Delaware and Nevada offer companies similar benefits as the laws in the British Virgin Islands.

We analyze the effect of the increase in industrial robot usage between 1990 and 2007 on US local labor markets. Using a model in which robots compete against human labor in the production of different tasks, we show that robots may reduce employment and wages, and that the local labor market effects of robots can be estimated by regressing the change in employment and wages on the exposure to robots in each local labor market—defined from the national penetration of robots into each industry and the local distribution of employment across industries. Using this approach, we estimate large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages across commuting zones. We bolster this evidence by showing that the commuting zones most exposed to robots in the post-1990 era do not exhibit any differential trends before 1990. The impact of robots is distinct from the impact of imports from China and Mexico, the decline of routine jobs, offshoring, other types of IT capital, and the total capital stock (in fact, exposure to robots is only weakly correlated with these other variables). According to our estimates, one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0.18-0.34 percentage points and wages by 0.25-0.5 percent. },

We compare these forecasts to those made by PhD students and non-experts: undergraduates, MBAs, and an online sample. We document seven main results. First, the average forecast of experts predicts quite well the experimental results. Second, there is a strong wisdom-of-crowds effect: the average forecast outperforms 96 percent of individual forecasts. Third, correlates of expertise---citations, academic rank, field, and contextual experience--do not improve forecasting accuracy. Fourth, experts as a group do better than non-experts, but not if accuracy is defined as rank ordering treatments. Fifth, measures of effort, confidence, and revealed ability are predictive of forecast accuracy to some extent, especially for non-experts. Sixth, using these measures we identify `superforecasters' among the non-experts who outperform the experts out of sample.

  journal={The New York Times},  
  date={2017-02-07},  
  comment={Macroeconomics has been in a professional crisis since the 2007 financial crisis because they completely failed to predict the crisis. Preventing financial crises IS the job of macroeconomics, and they have proven time and again more or less incapable of doing that. ``Uniquely in the social sciences and humanities, macroeconomics was developed with a specific, real-world purpose, and a negative purpose to boot: to stop anything like the Great Depression from ever happening again. Given this goal — to avert systemic crises and downturns — the credit crunch and the Great Recession were, for macroeconomics, an intellectual disaster.'' While microeconomics has made great strides in recent years by adapoting science about behavorial economics, macroeconomics is still basing everything on ``rational actor'' models. `` It is a matter of provable fact that our decision-making is not entirely rational. Economic models built on the premise of our rationality will always have a creaky underpinning.'' Macroeconomics also is an insular self-referential field: ``He finds compelling evidence in a survey of American professors of social science, who were asked whether “interdisciplinary” knowledge was better than knowledge “obtained by a single discipline.” Most social scientists sensibly thought that the answer was yes, by overwhelming margins. But 57 percent of economists disagreed or strongly disagreed. Economists literally think they have nothing to learn from anyone else.'' Proposals for fixing this include ``agent based modeling'' which assumes individual behaviors and predicts, among other things, why Brazil nuts move to the top of a mixed-nut package. Also covers how macroeconomics doesn't actually includes allowances for how money works. ``Paul Romer is a highly regarded macroeconomist who recently became chief economist at the World Bank. (It was Romer who is credited with having coined, in 2004, the famous slogan that ``a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.'') Last winter he, too, issued a lacerating critique of his field, titled The Trouble With Macroeconomics. His argument focuses on the question of `identification,' which is shorthand in the field for how economists identify the cause of an event. Identification is a huge deal for economics, because if you can’t tell if x, y or z caused something, you don’t know which of those variables to study or measure or change. The omission of finance and the role of money from economic models is the biggest weakness in the field, Romer believes. It is hard for noneconomists to get our heads around the fact that the dominant macroeconomic models (including the ones used by central banks) made no allowance for how money works — especially not for fluctuations in how much of it is around. Such an oversight seems weird, and entirely counterintuitive. But that’s what happened, and it played a big role in macroeconomists’ ability to, as Romer puts it, "dismiss mere facts."''},

  date={2017-01-10},  
  comment={Looks at India's decision to eliminate common cash notes. This was done to undermine the cash economy in a place where the vast majority of people don't pay any income tax. Refers to a book called The Curse of Cash by Kenneth Rogodd which raises one argument for eliminating large denomination bills in the US: There's 4200 dollars in cash circulating for every person in the country, 80\% of that is in 100 bills. Where is all that money? Nobody knows, presumably in some kind of illicit scenario. The author has a different perspective raised at the end of the article though: ``I wonder, though, about the wisdom of the anti-cash crusade. The problem with the argument is that it concedes too much power to the modern triple-headed monster of the economy — the state, the central bank and the banking system. If there is no cash, there is nowhere for the private citizen to hide any assets at all, not just for criminal reasons but simply for financial security. The year 2008 was a reminder of how fragile our banking system is and how all-encompassing financial crisis can be. Merryn Somerset Webb, editor of the financial-advice magazine MoneyWeek, has argued that one of the best things an individual can do, with banks fragile and interest rates low, is buy a good safe and fill it with cash. I have no desire to do that myself, but it is reassuring to know that if I wanted to, I could.  The rich have many ways of hiding assets and making them safe from states and from the taxman. As we’ve recently been reminded, some very rich people don’t pay any income tax at all. Cash is one of the few ways in which ordinary citizens can enjoy a tiny taste of the freedom, privacy and security that the rich take as their due. That, for me, is what’s missing in the critique of cash. If there were to be a big, convincing, systemwide drive to tax the hidden assets of the rich, to drag them inside the same norms that constrain the rest of us, to make it clear that we are all playing by the same rules — well, then maybe we can start to talk about abolishing cash. Until then, we would do well to bear in mind a favorite line of the pro-cash lobby, Dostoyevsky’s observation from a czarist prison: “Money,” he wrote, “is coined liberty.”''},

  comment={Review of \textit{A Friendship That Changed Our Minds} by Michael Lewis, the guy who wrote Moneyball. Tells the story of how two researchers Kahneman and Tversky put forward a theory that humans use shorthand heuristics to undermine rationality. This research ``helped to reorder economics by exposing the folly of economists’ belief in an unconsciously rational human mind.'' ``Many people attracted to Kahneman and Tversky’s ideas have a little bit of Amos Tversky’s brashness in them. They (in fairness, I should say “we”) get some enjoyment from puncturing shibboleths with data and observation. As a result, they are often seen as arrogant and sometimes are indeed arrogant.'' ``The human species is fantastically complex and often doesn’t know what it is doing. The search for a better understanding of our behavior is vital. It’s also difficult, never-ending and still very much worth the struggle.''},

The Accord effectively tells dirty-energy producers to "use it or lose it." This may be accelerating their extraction and burning of fossil fuels and, thereby, be permanently raising temperatures.   
Our paper uses a simple OLG model to illustrate this long-noted Green Paradox. Its framework treats climate damage as a negative externality imposed by today’s generations on tomorrow’s – an externality that is, in part, irreversible and can tip the climate to permanently higher temperatures. In our model, delaying abatement can lead to larger changes in climate than doing nothing, reducing welfare for all generations. In contrast, immediate policy action can raise welfare for all generations.   
Finally we question the standard use of infinitely-lived, single-agent models, which assume, unrealistically, intergenerational altruism in determining optimal abatement policy. Their prescriptions can differ, potentially dramatically, from those needed to correct the negative climate externality today’s generations are imposing on tomorrow’s.},

If you grow up in a place with social programs they will help you do better. He uses the example of the Mona Lisa and how it was unknown until it was stolen. (Like the Kardashians, it is famous just for being famous.) ``Evidence from the social sciences demonstrates that beyond a certain income threshold, people’s sense of well-being depends much more on their relative purchasing power than on how much they spend in absolute terms. If top tax rates were a little higher, all homes would be a little smaller, all cars a little less expensive, all diamonds a little more modest and all celebrations a little less costly. The standards that define “special” would adjust accordingly, leaving most successful people quite satisfied.''},

 abstract = {How much does the current social security system really redistribute from rich to poor?  We use the PSID to estimate lifetime wage profiles and actual earnings each year for a sample of 1778 individuals, and we use mortality probabilities to calculate expected payroll taxes and social security benefits. For a given set of  facts' about the net flows received by each individual, measured progressivity depends on many assumptions. This paper attempts to capture and to quantify all of the individual characteristics that are relevant to determine the progressivity of a life-cycle program like social security. We proceed in seven steps.  First, we classify individuals by annual income and use Gini coefficients to find that social security is highly progressive.  Second, we reclassify individuals on the basis of lifetime income and find that social security is less progressive.  Third, we remove the cap on measured earnings and find that social security is even less progressive.  Fourth, we switch from actual to potential lifetime earnings (the present value of the wage rate times 4000 hours each year).  This measure captures the value of leisure and home production, so those out of the labor force are less poor, and net payments to them are less progressive.  Fifth, we assign to each married individual half of the couple's income.  The low-wage spouse is then not so poor less progressive.  Sixth, we incorporate mortality probabilities that differ by potential lifetime income.  Since the rich live longer and collect benefits longer, social security is no longer progressive.  Finally, we increase the discount rate from 2% to 4%, which puts relatively more weight on the earlier-but-regressive payroll tax and less weight on the later-but-progressive benefit schedule.  The whole social security system is then regressive.},

  date={2016-04-07},  
  comment = {Outlines the history of the rise of popularity of the word and concept `innovation' and compares that to our cultural neglect of the maintenance of infrastructure. ``In 2012, even the Wall Street Journal got into innovation-bashing act, noting ‘the Term Has Begun to Lose Meaning’. At the time, it counted ‘more than 250 books with “innovation” in the title… published in the last three months’. A professional innovation consultant it interviewed advised his clients to ban the word at their companies. He said it was just a ‘word to hide the lack of substance’.'' ``Evidence has emerged that regions of intense innovation also have systemic problems with inequality. In 2013, protests erupted in San Francisco over the gentrification and social stratification symbolised by Google buses and other private commuter buses. These shuttles brought high-tech employees from hip, pricey urban homes to their lush suburban campuses, without exposing them to the inconvenience of public transportation or to the vast populations of the poor and homeless who also call Silicon Valley their home. The dramatic, unnecessary suffering exposed by such juxtapositions of economic inequality seems to be a feature, not a bug of highly innovative regions.'' ``Third, focusing on infrastructure or on old, existing things rather than novel ones reminds us of the absolute centrality of the work that goes into keeping the entire world going. Despite recurring fantasies about the end of work or the automation of everything, the central fact of our industrial civilisation is labour, and most of this work falls far outside the realm of innovation. Inventors and innovators are a small slice – perhaps somewhere around one per cent – of this workforce. If gadgets are to be profitable, corporations need people to manufacture, sell, and distribute them.'' ``The most unappreciated and undervalued forms of technological labour are also the most ordinary: those who repair and maintain technologies that already exist, that were ‘innovated’ long ago.'' ``Crack cocaine, for example, was a highly innovative product in the 1980s, which involved a great deal of entrepreneurship (called ‘dealing’) and generated lots of revenue. Innovation! Entrepreneurship! Perhaps this point is cynical, but it draws our attention to a perverse reality: contemporary discourse treats innovation as a positive value in itself, when it is not.''},

% This essay also nicely supports the argument - once again - that manufacturing/labor are critical to an successful economy.

% ``In her classic 1983 book, More Work for Mother, Ruth Schwartz Cowan examined home technologies – such as washing machines and vacuum cleaners – and how they fit into women’s ceaseless labour of domestic upkeep. One of her more famous findings was that new housekeeping technologies, which promised to save labour, literally created more work for mother as cleanliness standards rose, leaving women perpetually unable to keep up.''

The perception of many on the left is that banks were once well ­regulated and then the oversight stopped.

For many on the right, of course, this is itself the problem: All that government intrusion, they argue, is stifling the financial system. But Richardson and Acharya’s research shows that we’re in a scarier place than either side realizes. By freeing banks’ hands, reducing regulation might incentivize them to engage in more rent-­seeking.

Each essay covers the institutional history of a program, the policy issues surrounding it, its rules and regulations, its history of expenditure and caseloads, and, most importantly, a summary of the research that economists have conducted on the program and the findings from that research. The volume is an update of a popular first volume in 2003 which became a reference Handbook on the shelf of all economists and policy-makers who work on, or who are interested in, transfer programs in the United States. The new volume focuses primarily on the changes in programs which have occurred since 2003 and the results of new research since that date. The volume will be a timely contribution to on-going policy discussions in Washington and elsewhere, bringing the available evidence to bear on the many issues surrounding those programs.},  
 comment = {This is the introduction to a book that introduces the economics of different welfare systems. ``While the mix of different programs in the U.S. shown in Table 1 may seem to be a rather crazy - quilt assortment of programs with different structures and recipient groups, rather than following from some single rational desi gn for assistance for the poor of all types, it does reflect what are commonly regarded as voter preferences in the country.  For example, most programs are in - kind in nature, providing subsidies for specific consumption goods like medical care, food consu mption and nutritional assistance, housing, and early childhood education.  When cash is provided, it is generally not provided universally to all low - income families, but only to those with specific characteristics, like workers (the EITC) or the aged and disabled (SSI).   The only quasi - general cash program in the country is the TANF program, but it has shrunk dramatically, providing only a modest level of benefits and only to a restricted set of families, again presumably reflecting disfavor for giving a general cash transfer in return for low income per se.  For example, n o cash program exists for poor , nonelderly and nondisabled childless nonworkers, whether single individuals or married, and only in - kind benefits are provided to other nonworkers.'' ``Five distinct periods are discernible.   The first phase began in the 1960s (although not shown in the figure) and ran through the mid - 1970s.  In this classic period of expansion of the welfare state in the U.S., the AFDC program expanded and grew , the Food Stamp program was exten ded to the nation as a whole, the SSI program was created, and housing aid was expanded.   The second phase ran from the mid - 1970s to the late1980s, when expenditures flattened out, with no growth.   The flattening out was a result of growth in the Food Stamp and housing programs offset by declines in spending on AFDC and SSI.   The third phase, running from the late 1980s to the mid - 1990s, saw another large increase in spending, exceeding that in the early 1970s in some cases.   The growth resulted from major expansions in the EITC and in the SSI and subsidized housing programs.   The fourth phase ran from the mid - 1990s to 2007, with some expansion in overall spending but relatively little on the top 10 programs.  Spending on AFDC declined as it was changed to the TANF program, spending leveled off in the SSI program , housing programs, and the EITC, but a new Child Tax Credi t (CTC) was introduced, pushing up spending.  The Great Recession constitutes the fifth phase, where per capita spending on the 10 largest programs grew by 15 percent from 2007 to 2011, arising from increases in expenditure particularly in the recently - renamed SNAP program, the EITC, and SSI.''},

We offer new evidence about the consequences of gentrification on mobility, building and neighborhood conditions, using longitudinal New York City Medicaid records from January 2009 to December 2015 to track the movement of a cohort of low-income children over seven years, during a period of rapid gentrification in the city.  We leverage building-level data to examine children in market rate housing separately from those in subsidized housing. We find no evidence that gentrification is associated with meaningful changes in mobility rates over the seven-year period.  It is associated with slightly longer distance moves. As for changes in neighborhood conditions, we find that children who start out in a gentrifying area experience larger improvements in some aspects of their residential environment than their counterparts who start out in persistently low-socioeconomic status areas. This effect is driven by families who stay in neighborhoods as they gentrify; we observe few differences in the characteristics of destination neighborhoods among families who move, though we find modest evidence that children moving from gentrifying areas move to lower-quality buildings.},

We test the hypotheses that gentrification directly displaces homeowners by increasing their property taxes, and that property tax limitation protects residents of gentrifying neighborhoods from displacement, by merging the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with a decennial Census-tract-level measure of gentrification and a new data set on state-level property tax policy covering the period 1987 to 2009. We find some evidence that property tax pressure can trigger involuntary moves by homeowners, but no evidence that such displacement is more common in gentrifying neighborhoods than elsewhere, nor that property tax limitation protects long-term homeowners in gentrifying neighborhoods. We do find evidence that gentrification directly displaces renters. },
