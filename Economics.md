}  
% Page 3: "Surely one has to pay one's debts" is a _moral_ concept widely shared, but not actually a part of standard economic theory. In reality, loans _have_ to have risk involved (that is, the risk that you won't pay your debt), to deter loans being made on unnecessarily risky ventures. eg, a bank would never loan you a million dollars to bet on a horse because it knows it would never get the money back if you lost it. The responsibility is not JUST on the person who owes the debt, but the loaner takes on the risk of the person not being able to pay the debt by making the loan in the first place. That's THEIR responsibility.  
% Chapter 2, The Myth of Barter, explains how the first thing all economics textbook teach is that first came barter, then came coined money, then debt. In fact, the anthropological evidence shows (and has been known for more than 100 years, Page 40) that first came debt (Page 39: Sumerian temples would accept virtually anything in payment of debts), then money, and barter systems were entirely the result of situations where money disappeared for some reason . Barter systems only appear in situations where people still assign value of coins to objects, even though the coins may no longer be available. Even though barter systems are extremely rare in human society, economics always teaches the barter system as the lower form because it is fundamental to the myth necessary to create the "science" of economics because economists believe that stripping away money would leave barter -- where everyone has a set value for the goods they stockpile (page 44).   
% Page 36: the gift economy. This is what Graeber argues is what the anthropological evidence shows. In a small group where everyone knows everyone else, it is easier to simply give a thing to anyone who needs it, and then you chock that up as a favor the person owes you, where you expect them to reciprocate the gift at some point in the future when you have your own need. Whether to give a gift is based on the relationship with the other person: are they a friend, family, or neighbor? ---Things that go wholly unaccounted for in the field of economics. This mode of supplying gifts to people for when they need something is still present in our lives every day (think of keeping kids in clothes or neighbors helping to put a roof on).  
	% This is wholly convincing, to me. And clearly Graeber is headed towards a place where the concept of "economics" is entirely a construct used to exploit people. But it seems clear, even at this point, that the gift economy works great in a small group where everyone knows each other, while barter or debt becomes a (maybe?) necessary part of any system larger than a hundred people or so. Debt is _how_ you can have a fair relationship with another group that you don't have a personal relationship with. Is there any other way? To me it reads like what the economists got complete wrong is that people are economic beings. But it does seem like economics might actually be a real natural phenomenon for interaction between groups?  
% Page 50: States and markets are intimately related: King create coins and give them to their soldiers and at the same time the king requires coins back in taxes. Then people have to supply the soldiers with food and supplies in order to get the coins to pay their taxes.  
% Page 71: "This is the great trap of the twentieth century: on one side is the logic of the market, where we like to imagine we all start out as individuals who don't owe each other anything. ON the other is the logic of the state, where we all begin with a debt we can never truly pay. We are constantly told that they are opposites and between them they contain the only real human possibilities. But it's a false dichotomy. States created markets. Markets require states. Neither could continue without the other, at least in anything like the forms we would recognize today."  
% Page 74: Credit markets are based on trust. So much so that _anything_ could be turned into money, as long as someone everyone knows and trusts will accept it as payment for debt. But between strangers, there is no trust. So in trade with another nation, a money that has value accepted by both must be used (ie precious metals). So Roman silver coins circulated at above their metal value because the Roman government would accept them at that value. But in trade with other nations, Roman silver was worth the silver it was minted with, though the same coins were used to pay debts.  
	% And you can see here how backing money with gold works: it's entirely unnecessary until you want to trade with another nation. But, if other nations all see, say, the American dollar as having the same value Americans see it as, then backing it with precious metals is indeed unnecessary.  
% Page 79: The Eskimo refuses thanks for a load of meat, because he lives in a gift economy in the North, and the bounty that is his one day might be someone else's the next, and it's pointless to tally them. "Up here we say that by gifts one makes slaves and by whips one makes dogs."  
	% Again, it seems that Graeber is heading towards this argument that a gift economy is the natural human way and we should strive towards it. But I still don't see how he climbs away from the fact that gift economies are about (essentially) family, and friends who might be family, or at most your tribe. Once you need to interact with strangers (whether from another nation or even at a scale larger than your local town) how do you carry out the economy? All his examples seem to point to exactly this: _tallying_ of debts and money-as-barter is the _tool_ for fair interactions between people who can't trust each other. And that is coming up again and again through human history. Is there any other way? It seems unlikely.  
% Page 94: A section on "communism." Graeber swipes aside the conventional idea of "communism" (the Soviets), and argues here that a baseline "communism" exists in almost all everyday interactions between people. That is, for most things and labors, they are in fact distributed "from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs." And then proceeds to lay out how a smoker might bum a cigarette with no expectation that they would get one back, or fishermen might help each other patch nets, or a mechanic might ask someone to pass a wrench, that no mother expects a child to repay her. And he points out that it's not that anyone expects someone WILL reciprocate, but that they WOULD reciprocate (thus, not a debt, he argues). That all seems right to me, but what he doesn't address (yet?) is again this idea of scale. The interesting thing, I think, is not really that people fundamentally help those in a shared group, but where and when they draw the line between their shared group and strangers. The failure of what is conventionally understood as "communism" wasn't the idea itself, it was the attempt to apply it at the national level. It's not clear to me (or maybe even to Graeber) that this failure of communism is incorrect. It did fail, and it's hard to imagine how it could not. He describes how (his version of) communism includes that almost no one would refuse accurate directions to a stranger. But he also points out that (his version of) communism is done both from a very low cost (it costs almost nothing to give a stranger accurate directions) and giving people who have more skills the things they need to do a task. I would argue that ALL people ALWAYS draw a line between where their personal communisitic commitment to their community ends, and strangers begin asking too much of them. It varies widely from culture to culture, so an idealist might point to examples of generosity and widely expanded communism from other cultures (so Graeber leans on indigenous Amerian culture) but I would point out that there is ALWAYS a point where the stranger can ask too much, and they will be refused. And it's not clear this is _bad_. The North Sentinel islanders, by having a culture that says anyone not from their island is their enemy and shot at them, have managed to preserve their culture in the face of modernization in a way that no other more generous group ever has. My sense of low-contact tribes world wide is that the tribes all vary widely in who they consider a stranger, and how generous they are with those outside their communistic group. (And those tribes that are more generous to strangers have only succumbed to modernity more quickly, and often miserably.)  
	% This all comes back to the same question I asked in my Anarchy undergrad class 25 years ago: Sure, anarchy/communism is great in my small community. But I want a computer. How do I get a society large-scale enough that I can have a computer in a system that is based on gift/need larger than just my local community? At least Graeber is helping me make this question much more clear and explicit.     
% Page 102, Exchange: Here he points out that to settle a transaction is to _end_ a relationship with someone. If someone gives you a gift and you pay them the value of that gift, the relationship is essentially at an end. Whereas if you give another gift of a slightly different value, then they may be in your debt, or you continue to be in their debt, so the relationship continues. What he doesn't cover (yet) is why this might be a bad thing. Would you WANT to be in a relationship with every person in your life? Hell no. The ability to settle the debt is _useful_, not something bad (though, to be fair, he has not yet said it IS bad, just insinuated that there could be something more). The last paragraph of this section he admits that this is not totally distinguishable from barter (or, to my mind, the economist view of humanity that sees everything in terms of values). He does not really explain (yet) why this is NOT barter/economics.

(It’s now $1.90 a day.) In 2000, United Nations member states pledged to cut extreme poverty worldwide — specifically to halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, from 1990 levels, by 2015. Bottom line: The U.N. goal was met. By 2015, the share of the world’s population living in extreme poverty fell to 12 percent from 36 percent in 1990, a steep decline in just two and a half decades. During a single generation, more than a billion people around the world climbed out of extreme poverty, surpassing the goal." Why?

% And The World Bank estimates that social safety net programs are responsible for 36 percent of the global reduction in extreme poverty accounting for much of the reduction in poverty outside of China.

  comment={Krugman argues that Trump's tax cut basically had no impact on the economy because business decisions are a lot less sensitive to financial incentive (tax rates among others) than conservatives claim. He also points out that interest rate changes affect the economy almost entirely through their effect on the _housing market_ and the international value of the dollar. Interest rate changes have almost no effect directly on business investment. Krugman points out that the truth of this business insensitivity to these marginal incentives undermines not just the Trump tax cut, but the whole conservative financial agenda. Bush's tax cuts didn't produce a business boom, and Obama's tax hikes didn't cause a depression.},

  comment={The new gilded age of wealth for the wealthy rests on the rise of institutional investors. These are companies like mutual funds that slowly buy up shares until they own a controlling amount of a company --- and then until they own a controlling amount of a whole industry. When that happens, their economic incentive is to push the companies they own to drive up costs and drive wages down. Institutional investors own 70 percent of the stock market today; while they owned 7 percent in 1950. ``If you count them as a single investor, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are the largest owner of 88 percent of the companies in the Standard \& Poor’s 500.'' This is actually illegal, there is a law that says it is illegal for a single company to buy shares in an industry such that it effectively forms a monopoly. But no legal action has been taken. This op-ed suggests that the law should be adapted so that institutional investors cannot take a controlling share in more than one company in an industry. This op-ed also contains link to scholarly papers on the topic.},

Across a broad range of case studies at various levels of (dis)aggregation, we find that ideas — and in particular the exponential growth they imply — are getting harder and harder to find.

  comment={When men and women finish school and start working, they’re paid pretty much equally. The pay gap between genders widens as people age, spreading most sharply in their late 20s to mid 30s --- when many women have children. Unmarried women without children continue to earn closer to what men do. Even married women without children earn less, research shows, because women are more likely to give up job opportunities to either move or stay put for their husband’s job. Married women might also take less intensive jobs in preparation for children, or employers might not give them more responsibility because they assume they’ll have babies and take time off. Couples typically decide that the person who earns less should stay home and take care of the house. But that often ends up being the woman because she earns less because it is assumed she will end up staying home to take care of a household. Interestingly there is much less of a gap (about half as much) for people without college degrees. This is because earnings are higher and men dominate the highest-paying jobs. Also there is a strong emphasis on long inflexible hours.},

  date={2017-05-12},  
  comment={Wealthy people tend to share less of what they have with others. Possibly because money allows people to achieve their goals without depending on others, so it cultivates a mind-set of self-sufficiency that is at odds with charity. Poorer people are quicker to turn to their friends and family for help (with anything: moving, money, cleaning, whatever) while rich people will just hire someone. For this reason wealthy people teach their children to prioritize individuality, while poorer people focus on the needs of the group. Research suggests that taking this into account, it is easier to get rich people to donate to charity by catering to their sense of themselves. Meaning: ask wealthy people to "take individual action" rather than "contribute to the goals of the group." The researchers point out that we often want to change people to do things for the right reason, but really we just need them to do the right thing.},

We analyze the effect of the increase in industrial robot usage between 1990 and 2007 on US local labor markets. Using a model in which robots compete against human labor in the production of different tasks, we show that robots may reduce employment and wages, and that the local labor market effects of robots can be estimated by regressing the change in employment and wages on the exposure to robots in each local labor market—defined from the national penetration of robots into each industry and the local distribution of employment across industries. Using this approach, we estimate large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages across commuting zones. We bolster this evidence by showing that the commuting zones most exposed to robots in the post-1990 era do not exhibit any differential trends before 1990. The impact of robots is distinct from the impact of imports from China and Mexico, the decline of routine jobs, offshoring, other types of IT capital, and the total capital stock (in fact, exposure to robots is only weakly correlated with these other variables). According to our estimates, one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0.18-0.34 percentage points and wages by 0.25-0.5 percent. },

We compare these forecasts to those made by PhD students and non-experts: undergraduates, MBAs, and an online sample. We document seven main results. First, the average forecast of experts predicts quite well the experimental results. Second, there is a strong wisdom-of-crowds effect: the average forecast outperforms 96 percent of individual forecasts. Third, correlates of expertise---citations, academic rank, field, and contextual experience--do not improve forecasting accuracy. Fourth, experts as a group do better than non-experts, but not if accuracy is defined as rank ordering treatments. Fifth, measures of effort, confidence, and revealed ability are predictive of forecast accuracy to some extent, especially for non-experts. Sixth, using these measures we identify `superforecasters' among the non-experts who outperform the experts out of sample.

  date={2017-02-07},  
  comment={Macroeconomics has been in a professional crisis since the 2007 financial crisis because they completely failed to predict the crisis. Preventing financial crises IS the job of macroeconomics, and they have proven time and again more or less incapable of doing that. ``Uniquely in the social sciences and humanities, macroeconomics was developed with a specific, real-world purpose, and a negative purpose to boot: to stop anything like the Great Depression from ever happening again. Given this goal — to avert systemic crises and downturns — the credit crunch and the Great Recession were, for macroeconomics, an intellectual disaster.'' While microeconomics has made great strides in recent years by adapoting science about behavorial economics, macroeconomics is still basing everything on ``rational actor'' models. `` It is a matter of provable fact that our decision-making is not entirely rational. Economic models built on the premise of our rationality will always have a creaky underpinning.'' Macroeconomics also is an insular self-referential field: ``He finds compelling evidence in a survey of American professors of social science, who were asked whether “interdisciplinary” knowledge was better than knowledge “obtained by a single discipline.” Most social scientists sensibly thought that the answer was yes, by overwhelming margins. But 57 percent of economists disagreed or strongly disagreed. Economists literally think they have nothing to learn from anyone else.'' Proposals for fixing this include ``agent based modeling'' which assumes individual behaviors and predicts, among other things, why Brazil nuts move to the top of a mixed-nut package. Also covers how macroeconomics doesn't actually includes allowances for how money works. ``Paul Romer is a highly regarded macroeconomist who recently became chief economist at the World Bank. (It was Romer who is credited with having coined, in 2004, the famous slogan that ``a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.'') Last winter he, too, issued a lacerating critique of his field, titled The Trouble With Macroeconomics. His argument focuses on the question of `identification,' which is shorthand in the field for how economists identify the cause of an event. Identification is a huge deal for economics, because if you can’t tell if x, y or z caused something, you don’t know which of those variables to study or measure or change. The omission of finance and the role of money from economic models is the biggest weakness in the field, Romer believes. It is hard for noneconomists to get our heads around the fact that the dominant macroeconomic models (including the ones used by central banks) made no allowance for how money works — especially not for fluctuations in how much of it is around. Such an oversight seems weird, and entirely counterintuitive. But that’s what happened, and it played a big role in macroeconomists’ ability to, as Romer puts it, "dismiss mere facts."''},

  Title={Should We Trash Cash?},  
  journal={The New York Times},  
  date={2017-01-10},  
  comment={Looks at India's decision to eliminate common cash notes. This was done to undermine the cash economy in a place where the vast majority of people don't pay any income tax. Refers to a book called The Curse of Cash by Kenneth Rogodd which raises one argument for eliminating large denomination bills in the US: There's 4200 dollars in cash circulating for every person in the country, 80\% of that is in 100 bills. Where is all that money? Nobody knows, presumably in some kind of illicit scenario. The author has a different perspective raised at the end of the article though: ``I wonder, though, about the wisdom of the anti-cash crusade. The problem with the argument is that it concedes too much power to the modern triple-headed monster of the economy — the state, the central bank and the banking system. If there is no cash, there is nowhere for the private citizen to hide any assets at all, not just for criminal reasons but simply for financial security. The year 2008 was a reminder of how fragile our banking system is and how all-encompassing financial crisis can be. Merryn Somerset Webb, editor of the financial-advice magazine MoneyWeek, has argued that one of the best things an individual can do, with banks fragile and interest rates low, is buy a good safe and fill it with cash. I have no desire to do that myself, but it is reassuring to know that if I wanted to, I could.  The rich have many ways of hiding assets and making them safe from states and from the taxman. As we’ve recently been reminded, some very rich people don’t pay any income tax at all. Cash is one of the few ways in which ordinary citizens can enjoy a tiny taste of the freedom, privacy and security that the rich take as their due. That, for me, is what’s missing in the critique of cash. If there were to be a big, convincing, systemwide drive to tax the hidden assets of the rich, to drag them inside the same norms that constrain the rest of us, to make it clear that we are all playing by the same rules — well, then maybe we can start to talk about abolishing cash. Until then, we would do well to bear in mind a favorite line of the pro-cash lobby, Dostoyevsky’s observation from a czarist prison: “Money,” he wrote, “is coined liberty.”''},

The Accord effectively tells dirty-energy producers to "use it or lose it." This may be accelerating their extraction and burning of fossil fuels and, thereby, be permanently raising temperatures.   
Our paper uses a simple OLG model to illustrate this long-noted Green Paradox. Its framework treats climate damage as a negative externality imposed by today’s generations on tomorrow’s – an externality that is, in part, irreversible and can tip the climate to permanently higher temperatures. In our model, delaying abatement can lead to larger changes in climate than doing nothing, reducing welfare for all generations. In contrast, immediate policy action can raise welfare for all generations.   
Finally we question the standard use of infinitely-lived, single-agent models, which assume, unrealistically, intergenerational altruism in determining optimal abatement policy. Their prescriptions can differ, potentially dramatically, from those needed to correct the negative climate externality today’s generations are imposing on tomorrow’s.},

  comment={It was Elon Musk and Tesla's vision to create an affordable long-range electric car. But General Motors will be launching a more affordable, longer-range, and potentially more reliable electric car, called the Chevy Bolt, more or less before Tesla does. This is a mostly a function of GM's size. Perversely, since the federal government limits GM's fleet emmissions, even if GM loses money on electric car sales, just the fact that they are selling them will allow them to sell more of the more profitable SUVs and pickups. In effect, every GM electric car sold is carbon-subsidizing a gas-guzzler. This article also discusses the assembly line quality improvement that Toyota uses where any work on a line can slow the line down if they find something wrong. Apparently Tesla has abandoned this technique and the quality of their cars is sufffering for it.},

We use the PSID to estimate lifetime wage profiles and actual earnings each year for a sample of 1778 individuals, and we use mortality probabilities to calculate expected payroll taxes and social security benefits. For a given set of  facts' about the net flows received by each individual, measured progressivity depends on many assumptions. This paper attempts to capture and to quantify all of the individual characteristics that are relevant to determine the progressivity of a life-cycle program like social security. We proceed in seven steps.  First, we classify individuals by annual income and use Gini coefficients to find that social security is highly progressive.  Second, we reclassify individuals on the basis of lifetime income and find that social security is less progressive.  Third, we remove the cap on measured earnings and find that social security is even less progressive.  Fourth, we switch from actual to potential lifetime earnings (the present value of the wage rate times 4000 hours each year).  This measure captures the value of leisure and home production, so those out of the labor force are less poor, and net payments to them are less progressive.  Fifth, we assign to each married individual half of the couple's income.  The low-wage spouse is then not so poor less progressive.  Sixth, we incorporate mortality probabilities that differ by potential lifetime income.  Since the rich live longer and collect benefits longer, social security is no longer progressive.  Finally, we increase the discount rate from 2% to 4%, which puts relatively more weight on the earlier-but-regressive payroll tax and less weight on the later-but-progressive benefit schedule.  The whole social security system is then regressive.},

  comment = {Outlines the history of the rise of popularity of the word and concept `innovation' and compares that to our cultural neglect of the maintenance of infrastructure. ``In 2012, even the Wall Street Journal got into innovation-bashing act, noting ‘the Term Has Begun to Lose Meaning’. At the time, it counted ‘more than 250 books with “innovation” in the title… published in the last three months’. A professional innovation consultant it interviewed advised his clients to ban the word at their companies. He said it was just a ‘word to hide the lack of substance’.'' ``Evidence has emerged that regions of intense innovation also have systemic problems with inequality. In 2013, protests erupted in San Francisco over the gentrification and social stratification symbolised by Google buses and other private commuter buses. These shuttles brought high-tech employees from hip, pricey urban homes to their lush suburban campuses, without exposing them to the inconvenience of public transportation or to the vast populations of the poor and homeless who also call Silicon Valley their home. The dramatic, unnecessary suffering exposed by such juxtapositions of economic inequality seems to be a feature, not a bug of highly innovative regions.'' ``Third, focusing on infrastructure or on old, existing things rather than novel ones reminds us of the absolute centrality of the work that goes into keeping the entire world going. Despite recurring fantasies about the end of work or the automation of everything, the central fact of our industrial civilisation is labour, and most of this work falls far outside the realm of innovation. Inventors and innovators are a small slice – perhaps somewhere around one per cent – of this workforce. If gadgets are to be profitable, corporations need people to manufacture, sell, and distribute them.'' ``The most unappreciated and undervalued forms of technological labour are also the most ordinary: those who repair and maintain technologies that already exist, that were ‘innovated’ long ago.'' ``Crack cocaine, for example, was a highly innovative product in the 1980s, which involved a great deal of entrepreneurship (called ‘dealing’) and generated lots of revenue. Innovation! Entrepreneurship! Perhaps this point is cynical, but it draws our attention to a perverse reality: contemporary discourse treats innovation as a positive value in itself, when it is not.''},

The perception of many on the left is that banks were once well ­regulated and then the oversight stopped. But banking regulation has in fact grown over the past 30 years, with more regulators enforcing more (and more complicated) rules. For many on the right, of course, this is itself the problem: All that government intrusion, they argue, is stifling the financial system. But Richardson and Acharya’s research shows that we’re in a scarier place than either side realizes. By freeing banks’ hands, reducing regulation might incentivize them to engage in more rent-­seeking.

Each essay covers the institutional history of a program, the policy issues surrounding it, its rules and regulations, its history of expenditure and caseloads, and, most importantly, a summary of the research that economists have conducted on the program and the findings from that research. The volume is an update of a popular first volume in 2003 which became a reference Handbook on the shelf of all economists and policy-makers who work on, or who are interested in, transfer programs in the United States. The new volume focuses primarily on the changes in programs which have occurred since 2003 and the results of new research since that date. The volume will be a timely contribution to on-going policy discussions in Washington and elsewhere, bringing the available evidence to bear on the many issues surrounding those programs.},  
 comment = {This is the introduction to a book that introduces the economics of different welfare systems. ``While the mix of different programs in the U.S. shown in Table 1 may seem to be a rather crazy - quilt assortment of programs with different structures and recipient groups, rather than following from some single rational desi gn for assistance for the poor of all types, it does reflect what are commonly regarded as voter preferences in the country.  For example, most programs are in - kind in nature, providing subsidies for specific consumption goods like medical care, food consu mption and nutritional assistance, housing, and early childhood education.  When cash is provided, it is generally not provided universally to all low - income families, but only to those with specific characteristics, like workers (the EITC) or the aged and disabled (SSI).   The only quasi - general cash program in the country is the TANF program, but it has shrunk dramatically, providing only a modest level of benefits and only to a restricted set of families, again presumably reflecting disfavor for giving a general cash transfer in return for low income per se.  For example, n o cash program exists for poor , nonelderly and nondisabled childless nonworkers, whether single individuals or married, and only in - kind benefits are provided to other nonworkers.'' ``Five distinct periods are discernible.   The first phase began in the 1960s (although not shown in the figure) and ran through the mid - 1970s.  In this classic period of expansion of the welfare state in the U.S., the AFDC program expanded and grew , the Food Stamp program was exten ded to the nation as a whole, the SSI program was created, and housing aid was expanded.   The second phase ran from the mid - 1970s to the late1980s, when expenditures flattened out, with no growth.   The flattening out was a result of growth in the Food Stamp and housing programs offset by declines in spending on AFDC and SSI.   The third phase, running from the late 1980s to the mid - 1990s, saw another large increase in spending, exceeding that in the early 1970s in some cases.   The growth resulted from major expansions in the EITC and in the SSI and subsidized housing programs.   The fourth phase ran from the mid - 1990s to 2007, with some expansion in overall spending but relatively little on the top 10 programs.  Spending on AFDC declined as it was changed to the TANF program, spending leveled off in the SSI program , housing programs, and the EITC, but a new Child Tax Credi t (CTC) was introduced, pushing up spending.  The Great Recession constitutes the fifth phase, where per capita spending on the 10 largest programs grew by 15 percent from 2007 to 2011, arising from increases in expenditure particularly in the recently - renamed SNAP program, the EITC, and SSI.''},

 abstract = {The pace of gentrification has accelerated in cities across the country since 2000, and many observers fear it is displacing low-income populations from their homes and communities. We offer new evidence about the consequences of gentrification on mobility, building and neighborhood conditions, using longitudinal New York City Medicaid records from January 2009 to December 2015 to track the movement of a cohort of low-income children over seven years, during a period of rapid gentrification in the city.  We leverage building-level data to examine children in market rate housing separately from those in subsidized housing. We find no evidence that gentrification is associated with meaningful changes in mobility rates over the seven-year period.  It is associated with slightly longer distance moves. As for changes in neighborhood conditions, we find that children who start out in a gentrifying area experience larger improvements in some aspects of their residential environment than their counterparts who start out in persistently low-socioeconomic status areas. This effect is driven by families who stay in neighborhoods as they gentrify; we observe few differences in the characteristics of destination neighborhoods among families who move, though we find modest evidence that children moving from gentrifying areas move to lower-quality buildings.},

abstract = { Scholars have long argued that gentrification may displace long-term homeowners by causing their property taxes to increase, and policy makers, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have cited this argument as a justification for state laws that limit the increase of residential property taxes. We test the hypotheses that gentrification directly displaces homeowners by increasing their property taxes, and that property tax limitation protects residents of gentrifying neighborhoods from displacement, by merging the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with a decennial Census-tract-level measure of gentrification and a new data set on state-level property tax policy covering the period 1987 to 2009. We find some evidence that property tax pressure can trigger involuntary moves by homeowners, but no evidence that such displacement is more common in gentrifying neighborhoods than elsewhere, nor that property tax limitation protects long-term homeowners in gentrifying neighborhoods. We do find evidence that gentrification directly displaces renters. },  
comment = {Finds that gentrification has almost no effect on homeowners, but greatly increases chances of RENTERS leaving. Renters have about the same chance of leaving because of gentrification as they do if they get a divorce. It's significant. Also finds that propterty taxes DON'T impact homeowners in gentrifying neighborhoods any more than in non-gentrifying ones.},

% This totally makes sense (and shocks me that the renter vs homeowner metric hasn't been broken out before!)  
% It actually explains how the research in things like freeman2005displacement jives with the experience of people on the ground.  
% This is one of those papers that backs up the notion that researchers really need to pay attention to common sense.

% Finding: Cultural strategies can transform places, creating new economic value but at the same time displacing existing meanings.  
%  Finding: Commercial gentrification can also transform a neighborhood’s meaning, but research is mixed on whether it is positive or negative for existing residents and businesses. (This is in response to Freeman)

%A couple of problems here:   
%One, I think these things are moving targets. A new popup telling you to print two-sided might work the first few times you see it, but when it becomes part of the background noise you might start to ignore it.   
%Two, small percentage point gains might be great at the scale of Google or the federal government, but on the scale that we actually live on - say writing emails to coworkers, those differences probably don't matter.   
%In addition, if A/B testing consistently yields _functional_ results, then the aesthetic of big organizations will become about efficient function. It seems likely that those those giant functional organizations that care about small percentage point changes will start to all have very similar designs, aesthetics, and operations developed with A/B testing nudging it all in the same direction. Those organizations will soon risk feeling like they don't have a unique or human voice. Which is maybe no shocking thing to say about the federal government, but consider the recent change to Google's logo.

  comment = {A review of Tom Vanderbilt's book “You May Also Like: Taste in an Age of Endless Choice”. ``“Nothing is more predictive of a person than his music preference,” Vanderbilt continues, paraphrasing what he learns from one of the Echo Nest’s founders, who points to correlations between genres and, for instance, political affiliations (country and Republicans; rap and Democrats; metal apparently has bipartisan appeal). These genres are determined less by the sound of the music itself than by the people who listen to them.'' ``Vanderbilt makes frequent reference to “Distinction,” Pierre Bourdieu’s pioneering 1979 study of taste as correlated largely with social and educational class, in which the French sociologist asked people of varying educational attainment to say whether scenes like a sunset or “tramps quarreling” would make for a “beautiful, interesting, meaningless or ugly photo.”'' ``He becomes uncharacteristically distraught over the argument — one with which I happen to agree — that a pleasurable cultural experience, even if popular and mass-­produced, shouldn’t be attended by guilt.'' Also reviews “Pretentiousness: Why It Matters,” by Dan Fox. He argues that pretension, or pretending to something else, is what allows us to shake off complacency and move beyond the status quo. ``retentiousness in his definition is not self-serious but playful, exemplified by the likes of Brian Eno (who has written about wanting “to turn the word ‘pretentious’ into a compliment”), Kate Bush and David Bowie, to name a few.''},
