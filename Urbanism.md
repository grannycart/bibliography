  comment={Uses the moves made by cities during the pandemic to open streets or allow drinking and eating on sidewalks as an example of the much larger problem of meaningful participation by low-income communities of color. Some of the argument for this criticism is made strongly in quotes within the article.},

% "“It would be very easy for us to just say, ‘We did a survey and 75 percent of Oaklanders say they support Slow Streets,’” Mr. Russo said. “When you see the fact that it’s disproportionately folks who are higher-income who really enjoy it, and people who are white who are saying that, that’s a very important thing for government to be listening to.” Those survey response rates echo research on public meetings about development, conducted by the political scientists Katherine Levine Einstein, David Glick and Maxwell Palmer. The people who show up for such meetings, thus shaping what kind of housing is built, tend to be older, whiter, higher-income and homeowners.  Those are the people with more time for public meetings, the flexibility to show up on a weeknight, and motivation to do so. They also wield the most power when they speak, with their homeowner’s concerns about property values at stake, or with their credentials as engineers, architects or lawyers who have read the zoning code."

% "“Participation processes are broken in two different ways,” said Professor Einstein, who teaches at Boston University. “They’re weaponized by privileged white people. And then when less privileged communities do try to use them, they’re not as effective as a tool for them.” Jeremy Levine, a sociologist who spent several years following community meetings in poorer neighborhoods of Boston, found that those meetings often served to give officials and developers the power to say “the community” is on board.  “More meetings, better-attended meetings or differently designed meetings will not alleviate these fundamental challenges,” said Mr. Levine, a professor at the University of Michigan.  This is the reality as cities consider what it would mean to have more community input: In city planning, participatory democracy has largely increased inequality, not lessened it."

This is after crime declined up to about 2014 in the wake of The Wire years. It argues that Baltimore is talked about by the right wing media only as "American carnage" with no sense of historical forces or societal abandonment. And the left wing media ignores Baltimore's crime problem because they have no way to engage with policing except as being fundamentally suspect.

Despite what you read about pollen blowing hundreds of miles, most pollen lands close by to wear it originated. Trees also do pull polutants out of the environment - and incorporate them into the tree, and males put them back out as pollen which is inhaled by humans (while females would drop pollutants in seeds, which would not be eaten by humans).

  comment={Sim City's algorithms were largely based on the theories put forth by Jay Forrester in his 1969 book Urban Dynamics. Forrester had built an early city simulator based on 150 equiations and 200 parameters. The simulator found that once the land area of a city was used up and the only way to grow was by replacing already existing structures, his simulated cities went into inevitable decline. This (unfortunately) matched what people were seeing with the urban crises of the 60s and 70s. Built into the models was classist assumptions, like the poor had higher birth rates, made fewer contributions to taxes, and increased public expenditures. (In addition, it was vastly oversimplified - almost to the point of an "outsider" like vision of cities.) Forrester was careful to not claim his simulations reflected particular cities, but made generalizations about cities in general. He claimed that programs aimed at helping the underemployed - particularly low-income housing - cost public resources and occupied land that could be more productively used for other thigns. Forrester's simulations gave a theoretical backing to conservative notions of "benign neglect" (ala Daniel Patrick Moynihan) hands-off urban policies. Forrester felt that throughout human history people have had a simplistic cause-and-effect approach to policy making based on our simplistic "mental models", but our social interactions are far more complex and we can't hold them in our heads. Because of that, he felt that the effects of social programs would be different than those imagined by policymakers. The intuitive solutions are "wrong most of the time". Things we do to try to improve society are likely to backfire. This is, of course, totally a conservative notion. Albert O. Hirschman calls this the "perversity thesis" and identifies it throughout history. Where a conservative speaker can claim they share your social goal, while simultaneasly arguing that your approach will only make it worse. ``Expert knowledge, of course, has an important place in democratic deliberation, but it can also cut people out of the policy process, dampen the urgency of moral claims, and program a sense of powerlessness into our public discourse. Appeals to a social system’s “complexity” and the potential for “perverse outcomes” can be enough to sink transformative social programs that are still on the drawing board. This might not matter in the context of a virtual environment like that of  Urban Dynamics or SimCity, but we have decades of real-world evidence that demonstrates the disastrous costs of the “counterintuitive” anti-welfare agenda. Straightforward solutions to poverty and economic misery—redistribution and  the provision of public services—have both empirical backing and moral force. Maybe it’s time we start listening to our intuition again. ''},

}  
% This is such an interesting observation, but the causes are SO much more complicated than just the corporatization of retail or expensive real estate. Rich people - the shoppers - simply aren't as sophisticated as they used to be (or think they are). And the internet combined with fast-fashion has democratized what is cutting edge in terms of fashion and style. Being rich no longer entitles you to first access to new and inspiring styles - it just entitles you expensive styles. Similarly "luxury" items are no longer strongly correlated with well-made things or a rarefied aesthetic, they are just correlated with cost. One luxury car is basically indistinguishable from another nowadays. One luxury apartment looks just like the next.  
% Instead, the truly beautiful, the new, and the culture-defining belong to the people who have the vision to seek them out, from the deepest corners of the internet and the dankest corners of upstate thrift stores. This is as it should be - let the rich rot with their bleached and boring overpriced and underwhelming junk.

Newer high rises are designed using computer modeling, but earthquakes are not predictable, and it's likely the models don't account for everything. The building code is pretty weak; it says buildings have to have a 90 percent chance of avoiding total collapse. Which means that 10 percent of the buildings COULD collapse. In addition, that's "total collapse" --- many buildings might stay upright but become nonfunctional and too expensive to repair. The Millennium Tower was built in 2009 and won all sorts of engineering awards. It has now sunk a foot and a half, and is leaning 14 inches towards its neighbors. Most of the development of high rises has been in the parts of San Francisco that are MOST at risk of liqufaction --- where the ground behaves like quicksand during an earthquake.},

US with a 2D representation of flood physics to produce estimates  
of flood hazard, which match to within 90% accuracy the skill of local models built with detailed data. These flood depths are combined with exposure datasets of commensurate resolution to calculate current and future flood risk. Our data show that the total US population exposed to serious flooding is 2.6–3.1 times higher than  
previous estimates, and that nearly 41 million Americans live within the 1% annual exceedance probability floodplain (compared to only 13 million when calculated using FEMA flood maps). We find that population and GDP growth alone are expected to lead to significant future increases in exposure, and this change may be exacerbated in the future by climate change.},

That’s enough to cause significant hearing loss over time. If you have an hour-long commute at such sound levels, your hearing has probably already been affected. Urban life also sustains average background noise levels of 60 decibels, which is loud enough to raise one’s blood pressure and heart rate, and cause stress, loss of concentration, and loss of sleep. Sirens are a particularly extreme example of the kind of noise inflicted on people every day: They ring at a sound-pressure level of 120 decibels —a level that corresponds with the human pain threshold, according to the World Health Organization.'' This article also retells the story of Julia Barnett Rice, the wealthy lady who fought against the sound of tugboat horns in the early part of the 20th Century. This article argues that her story set up a dynamic where noise was a nuisance to rich people --- who often got abatements at the cost of the livlihoods of poorer people, instead of a health issue affecting everyone. Still, city officials were often unwilling to curb industry noise because of the economic output of those businesses. But the noise from transportation and industrial businesses does the most health damage (not nightclibs). Noisy industrial businesses, airports, and highways tend to be near low-income neighborhoods.},

  journal={The New York Times},  
  date={2018-02-24},  
  comment={Some people in the tech industry dream of building whole cities from scratch, arguing that cities aren't evolving the way technology is. This is not radically different from other unsuccessful attempts at utopians cities built from the ground up --- which generally fail spectacularly. There is some arguments that many of the things that the tech dreamers want are similar to what urbanists want --- transit connections, affordable housing, dense walkable mixed neighborhoods. But the technologists want to solve the problems through engineering and technology, rather than fixing our current cities though politics. The technologists prize "first principles" --- the idea that breaking new ground opens new solutions, and also implies that historical awareness and traditional expertise can be limiting. They equate their ideas with early radical ideas about cities, like grids. And they suggest maybe all the rules of a city could fit in 100 pages. This article points out that urban planning utopias are not the only thing that failed, but even within technology planning has failed in the past --- NASA tried to get into the planning game back in the 1960s, thinking that their groundbreaking technologies in space exploration could be applied to all sorts of fields. ``Technologically optimized cities, he says, failed then for the same reason they would be unsuccessful now. Technology can help reduce traffic, or connect you faster to a ride home. “But a city is not at its fundamental level optimizable,” he said. A city’s dynamism derives from its inefficiencies, from people and ideas colliding unpredictably. It’s also unclear what you’d optimize an entire city for. Technologists describe noble aspirations like “human flourishing” or “quality of life.” But noble goals come into conflict within cities.''},

  comment={Painted in broad simple strokes, Krugman outlines the dichotomy between Houston's no-regulation environment and how it contributed to the flooding disaster of Hurricane Harvey, and San Francisco's NIMBYist environment and how it contributes to the affordable housing crisis for low-income workers. Krugman points out that this is one of the few places where he agrees with the "both sides get it wrong" philosophy. He points out the San Francisco and Houston are extreme examples, but not that extreme in that many of the aspects that those cities represent are reflected in other major coastal cities versus southern sunbelt cities. Namely that there is nearly no regulation in the sunbelt cities, and NIMBYism prevents nearly anything from being done in the coastal elite cities.},

% Mostly I'm with Krugman in criticising NIMBYism, but there is an element to this where he is being both too much of an economist and too much focussed on the individual issue of affordable housing, rather than overall affordability of cities.   
% On econmics because I know fundamentally he believes in the basic supply and demand issue of housing, where if more housing is built at any price range, housing becomes cheaper overall. This has been proven wrong time and again in the real world, but it doesn't stop economists from believing it.  
% And the affordability of housing in those elite coastal cities is off-set to a large degree (though usually not entirely) by lower transportation costs. If you take into account the ability to live in NYC without owning a car, the affordability of the city dives into the average range.  
% See also this in-depth article on the same subject: \url{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/11/climate/houston-flooding-climate.html}  
``the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes.  The problem is that hurricanes and floods, worsened by climate change, do not recognize political borders or county lines. Their toll is shared by everyone.''  
``But what does “affordable” really mean if residents have to pay hefty transportation costs and rebuild, time and again, after floods? Houston’s affordability leans on loosely regulated, low-cost immigrant labor providing an abundance of cheaply made, slab-on-grade, single-family houses that sprawl on all that open land, in areas like the Katy Prairie.  And it relies heavily on American taxpayers providing government tax credits, mortgage interest deductions, gas subsidies, artificially low flood insurance rates, highway construction money — and emergency relief, including buying out homeowners to remove their properties from harm’s way.''

It may be they don't WANT the suburbs, but are forced there for economic reasons. And they choose that over rural areas because they want to be as close to the city center as they can reasonably afford.  
% In this telling (for which no data is provided here) the city centers might still be growing, but the suburbs grow faster for affordability reasons, making the data look like people are still choosing suburbs over cities.

Identification is aided by both institutional hurdles and idiosyncratic delays in the municipalisation process. Municipalisation lowered deaths from typhoid fever, a waterborne disease, by nearly 20% but deaths from non-waterborne causes were unaffected.

They might have similar low-incomes as the current residents, and so are willing to take the risk of moving there. But once they are there, more white people around might make wealthier people feel like it's now a safe neighborhood. (Not to mention that developes see artists moving in and start building new buildings for wealthier people - a visual cue that for the rich that it's a place to move to.) It's the fact that they are WHITE that might actually make it seem safe for the rich, before the crime rate actually drops.  
% The crime rate dropping is an indicator for the VERY wealthy that they can move in.  
% and then of course the rich drive the artists on to other neighborhoods.

We compare a method which uses a visual heuristic for understanding areal aggregation to a method which uses a computational partitioning algorithm, and we reflect upon the strengths and limitations of both. We discuss how choices about input parameters and scale of analysis can lead to different results, and stress the importance of comparing computational results with “common sense” interpretations of geographic coherence. The results provide a new perspective on the functional economic geography of the United States from a megaregion perspective, and shed light on the old geographic problem of the division of space into areal units.},

And less than 1 percent of all federal spending for urban renewal between 1949 and 1964 went to relocation, Mr. Gans wrote.'' ``Four units of low-income housing were destroyed for every one new unit that was built. And more than two-thirds of the displaced were black or Hispanic, a pattern that was clear by 1963 when the author James Baldwin observed that urban renewal “means Negro removal.”'' ``The psychologist Marc Fried, studying the same West End community, later documented the severe grief those residents experienced after they lost their homes. They lived through what the Columbia researcher Mindy Fullilove has today eloquently named “root shock.” Pull people from their communities, she argues, and they experience trauma not unlike what happens when you uproot a plant.''},

Makes the argument that it isn't density per se that is good about cities but some of the aspects of density. References research that shows that happily living in a city is having a good commute and being able to easily get to all the things you need for living (post office, church, library, grocery store, restaurant, bar, cafe). This can be achieved in small towns if things are close together. Also: ``But it isn’t just convenience and transportation efficiency that draws so many of today’s urbanists to prize density. They point to the ways that density nurtures both innovation and social diversity to argue that there are fundamental “agglomeration effects” which result from gathering people and businesses together in close proximity. There’s certainly something to this: the geographer Waldo Tobler’s famous “first law of geography” states that “near things are more related than distant things,” and we are undoubtedly more likely to participate in both acts of social solidarity and economic interchange with people who are close at hand than with those who are far distant.  But it’s naïve to assume that all people have equal access to one another just because they happen to be bumping shoulders—a fantasy bred in the cozy atmosphere of elite college campuses and well-decorated coffeehouses. In reality, our social and economic interactions are highly stratified by barriers like race, gender, education, and class.''},

In Paris, the poor are banished beyond the périphérique so that when they revolt, they destroy their own banlieues rather than the French capital’s fussily maintained environment.'' ``Manhattan island is today a pristine vitrine on which the lower orders don’t even get to leave their mucky paw prints, but inside which the rich get to fulfil with unparallelled freedom their uninteresting desires.'' ``The point of the cities Benjamin loved, by contrast, was that they broke through physical, ethnic and class barriers.

Yet understanding the variety of these forms can help stakeholders make wise choices regarding how to plan and design urban regions in the future to meet goals such as livability and sustainability. Based on aerials, maps, and images available through Google and other sources, I develop a typology of built landscape forms found within 24 metropolitan regions worldwide and use GIS to map these forms and compare regions. The analysis shows that 27 basic types of built landscape make up metropolitan regions worldwide, of which nine are very common. Traditional urban types now make up a small fraction of most metropolitan areas worldwide, while suburban and exurban forms comprise the vast majority of the land area. There are noted regional differences in the mix of built landscape types.Takeaway for practice: Each built landscape form offers challenges and opportunities for planning objectives such as livability and sustainability. It is important for planners to a) help the public and decision makers understand built landscapes and their implications; b) include landscape-scale elements, such as street patterns and networks of green infrastructure, when framing urban development alternatives; c) ensure that local codes and design guidelines enable desired forms of built landscapes and discourage those that are problematic for sustainability; and d) encourage built landscape change that promotes sustainability. },

This paper examines these questions within a model of recombinant growth and endogenous local amenities. Three primary factors determine the trade-off between networks and big cities: local returns to scale in innovation, the elasticity of housing supply, and the importance of local amenities. Even if there are global increasing returns, the returns to local scale in innovation may be decreasing, and that makes networks more appealing than mega-cities. Inelastic housing supply makes it harder to supply more space in dense confines, which perhaps explains why networks are more popular in regulated Europe than in the American Sunbelt. Larger cities can dominate networks because of amenities, as long as the benefits of scale overwhelm the downsides of density. In our framework, the skilled are more likely to prefer mega-cities than the less skilled, and the long-run benefits of either mega-cities or networks may be quite different from the short-run benefits.},

  comment = {``Until the early 1980s, a long-running feature of American history was the gradual convergence of income across regions. The trend goes back to at least the 1840s, but grew particularly strong during the middle decades of the 20th century.'' ``starting in the early 1980s, the long trend toward regional equality abruptly switched. Since then, geography has come roaring back as a determinant of economic fortune, as a few elite cities have surged ahead of the rest of the country in their wealth and income.'' ``But over the last generation this trend, too, has reversed. Since 1980, the states and metro areas with the highest and fastest-growing per capita incomes have generally seen hardly, if any, net domestic in-migration, and in many notable examples have seen more people move away to other parts of the country than move in. Today, the preponderance of domestic migration is from areas with high and rapidly growing incomes to relatively poorer areas where incomes are growing at a slower pace, if at all.'' ``Throughout most of the country’s history, American government at all levels has pursued policies designed to preserve local control of businesses and to check the tendency of a few dominant cities to monopolize power over the rest of the country. These efforts moved to the federal level beginning in the late 19th century and reached a climax of enforcement in the 1960s and ’70s. Yet starting shortly thereafter, each of these policy levers were flipped, one after the other, in the opposite direction, usually in the guise of “deregulation.” Understanding this history, largely forgotten today, is essential to turning the problem of inequality around.'' Mostly we are talking about anti-trust regulations and anti-big-chain-store regulations of the 20s and 30s, led by Woodrow Wilson and Louis Brandeis, which prevented wealth from concentrating in big cities. But also includes laws preventing patent monopolies and bank mergers. Also tackles the decline of transit funding.},

Beyond that, people cannot effectively commute.  High-speed rail, Professor Zhang said, has changed that equation.

We analyze the idea inputs of nearly every US patent granted during 1836–2010.

  comment = {Max's review of Good Neighbors by Sylvie Tissot. ``Through such benign-sounding activities as philanthropy, historic preservation, and serving on committees for parks and liquor licenses, gentrifiers solidified their position in the community and began to erase the cultural presence of those who preceded them. Tissot draws on years of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews, as well as historical material on the South End (much of which appears in fascinating boxed-text asides), to demonstrate how culture was used as a cudgel in a protracted battle of neighborhood realpolitik.'' ``Tissot implies that these gentrifiers, in prioritizing upper-middle-class, white prerogatives, did not just disagree over the proper uses of public spaces but were specifically drawn to concerns that privileged their cultural knowledge and maintained them in a position of prominence.'' ``Good Neighbors powerfully demonstrates how gentrifiers often fixate on the old (homes) and the marginally political (greenmarkets) so that they do not have to think about the displacement involved in neighborhood change and their own role in it.'' ``Newcomers endeavor to project a relaxed and egalitarian nature by working through civic groups rather than more formal channels of institutional and state power (although these are always there if they need them).

  date={2016-07-11},  
  comment={Discusses the use of the word `ghetto' to mean something bad. And how ``The opposite of gentrification is not a quirky and charming enclave that stays affordable forever; the opposite of gentrification is a decline in prices that reflects the transformation of a once desirable neighborhood into one that is looking more like a ghetto every day.'' Also covers how, while in NYC poor black neighborhoods might be likely to gentrify, this isn't (yet) the case in other places, like Chicago.  ``Do tenants have a political right—a human right—to remain in their apartments? In New York, regulations like rent stabilization not only limit the amount by which some landlords can raise rents but also restrict a landlord’s ability to decline to renew a lease. In Sweden, the rules are tighter: rents are set through a national negotiation between tenants and landlords, which means that prices are low in Stockholm, but apartments are scarce; a renter in search of a long-term lease there might spend decades on a government waiting list. Another solution is to allow more and taller buildings, increasing supply in the hope of lowering prices. Often, the steepest rent increases are found in places, like San Francisco, that have stringent building regulations: a recent study of the city found that fewer poor residents had been displaced in neighborhoods with more new construction. In seeking to preserve what Ruth Glass called the “social character” of a neighborhood, anti-gentrification activists echo the language that was once used to defend racially restrictive covenants. Arguments over gentrification are really arguments over who deserves to live in a city, and the notion of a right to stay put is sometimes at odds with another, perhaps more fundamental right: the right to move.'' ``In the ghetto narrative, a poor neighborhood falls victim to isolation; in the gentrification narrative, a poor neighborhood falls victim to invasion. These stories are not necessarily contradictory—they reflect a common conviction that the sorrows and joys of neighborhood change tend to be unequally shared. One effect of gentrification is to make this inequality harder to ignore. The call to save a neighborhood is most compelling when it serves as a call to help a neighborhood’s neediest inhabitants. That might mean helping them stay. But it might also mean helping them leave.''},

% Refers to the freeman2005displacement paper as evidence that gentrification doesn't impact poor households negatively.

While there is consensus that gentrification shaped social and physical aspects of neighbourhoods, scholars have yet to agree on how gentrified neighbourhoods should be identified. Owing to the lack of consensus, gentrification was measured in a variety of ways, which greatly influenced the neighbourhoods studied in previous research and potentially the findings of research that assessed the importance of gentrification for other neighbourhood outcomes. The current study contributes to this debate by applying and comparing two census-based strategies for identifying gentrified neighbourhoods with a qualitative neighbourhood selection strategy derived from The New York Times to New York City neighbourhoods for the span of years from 1980 to 2009. Results confirm that each of the strategies identified different neighbourhoods and that qualitative strategies for identifying gentrified neighbourhoods may overlook areas that experienced similar changes to those more widely recognised as gentrified. Given these findings, additional analyses assessed which census-based neighbourhood selection strategy better represented the neighbourhoods perceived by The New York Times, a major media outlet that shaped discourse on gentrification in the USA, as having experienced gentrification.},

Stein cites it as a major influence on later projects that were built, including the separation of road/ped and parking away from housing.  Radburn is interesting for not having a Greenbelt (which is key for Howards GCs), instead, Stein has them look towards the interior of their superblocks (the unit scale at which he designs) for green.

Some of these areas began as “suburbs within the city” in the 1800s and early 1900s and have maintained their positions atop the neighborhood hierarchy thanks to their appeal to a subset of high-income households.'' ``New York stands out from most other cities in that so many of its top households live in the middle of the central city. These super-rich neighborhoods — which spread into previously affordable areas, giving rise to much recent debate on gentrification — form the densest concentration of affluence in the United States, eclipsing the smaller privileged areas that have recently gentrified in Boston and DC.'' ``The productivity and higher costs of big CZs do not translate to higher incomes, education levels, and housing values in their bottom tracts. If anything, conditions in the bottom tracts are a little better on average in the smaller CZs — measured on this national scale — than in larger ones. The processes that add up to clustering by affluent households in privileged neighborhoods may therefore be leaving disadvantaged people behind in distressed neighborhoods.''},
