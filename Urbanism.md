}  
% This article is kinda all over the place, glomming together a bunch of arguments for green cities that don't seem, to my mind, to flow together linearly. He talks about the miracle of "bomb weed" growing in destroyed sections of European cities after WWII as an example of how nature is capable of coming back in unique ways quickly even in the worst environments as if just letting nature takes its course in places (and hey, why not just bomb out some places? says the punk rocker in me) was the best solution to green cities. But then he makes some convoluted argument that wild spaces also need tending, and then proceeds to list pretty much everything except traditional parks as examples of what he's talking about: lots to be developed left to be green spaces until they are, green roofs, walkways over nature areas, Fresh Kills -- these hardly seem like "neglect" to me. I don't understand what he thinks is the right balance of neglect vs tending. I'm not sure he does himself.  
% Also, not clear what this has to do with the post-pandemic period at all. (Nothing was bombed in the cities that I know of, nor is there suddenly a huge amount of unused space -- unless you include office space in Manhattan.)

% Page 268: Waterfronts too, can be made to act much more like seams than they ordinarily do today. The usual form of rescue for a decayed waterfront vacuum is to replace it with a park, which in turn becomes a border element---usually appallingly underused, as might be expected---and this moves the vacuum effect inland. It is more to the point to grasp the problem where it originates, at the shoreline, and aim at making the shore a seam. Waterfront work uses, which are often interesting, should not be blocked off from ordinary view for interminable stretches, and the water itself thereby blocked off from city view too at ground level. [Example of an industrial dock near her, with the line "Since it does not belong to the Parks Department nobody is forbidden anything." Then: This is not pretty-pretty, but it is an even greatly enjoyed on the dock.  
% Page 307: East Harlem is declared a deprived country, and money is poured in from decisions by absentee experts from the remote continent inhabited by housers and planners. The more that poured in, the worse became the turmoils and troubles of East Harlem, and still more did it becomes like a deprived, backward country.  
% Page 317: It is so easy to blame the decay of cities on traffic... or immigrants... or the whimsies of the middle class. The decay of cities goes deeper and is more complicated. It goes right down to what we think we want, and to our ignorance about how cities work. The forms in which money is used for city building---or withheld from use---are powerful instruments of city decline today. The forms in which money is used must be converted to instruments of regeneration---from instruments buying violent cataclysms to instruments buying continual, gradual, complex and gentler change.  
% Page 334 footnote: On rats: debunking the argument that new buildings have fewer rats. She points out that demolishing old buildings just displaces rats, and the only way to get rid of them is with extermination. Given that construction is widely understood now to increase rat populations, I'm not sure anyone is still making this argument that new buildings help with the rat problem.  
% Page 335: Corruption, on the other hand---either corruption for the sake of money or corruption for the sake of power---has a different nature from that of strait-laced bureaucracy. Corruption grows more inventive, rather than less so, the longer it has an object to play with. To combat both stultification and corruption, we ought, every eight or ten years at least, to try out new methods of subsidizing dwellings or add variations to old ones that are working well enough for us to retain. We ought even to call into being entirely new agencies for these new jobs, from time to time, and let old ones fade away. ... Deliberate, periodic changes in tactics of subsidy would afford opportunity to meet new needs that become apparent over time, but nobody can foresee in advance.  
% Page 343: We went awry by replacing, in effect, each horse on the crowded city streets with half a dozen or so mechanized vehicles, instead of using each mechanized vehicles to replace half a dozen or so horses. The mechanical vehicles, in their overabundance, work slothfully and idle much. As one consequence of such low efficiency, the powerful and speedy vehicles, choked by their own redundancy, don't move much faster than horses. Trucks, by and large, do accomplish much of what might have been hoped for from mechanical vehicles in cities. They do the work of much greater numbers of horse-drawn vehicles or of burden-laden men. But because passenger vehicles do not, this congestion, in turn, greatly cuts down the efficiency of the trucks.  
% Page 347: Excessive numbers of horses produced similar conflicts; people who have experienced an Amsterdam or New Delhi rush hour report that bicycle in massive numbers become an appalling mixture with pedestrians.

And spending on infrastructure as a fraction of the economy has shrunk, giving local agencies less experience in modern practices." "Bent Flyvbjerg, a professor at the University of Oxford who has studied scores of projects around the world, found that 92 percent of them overran their original cost and schedule estimates, often by large margins — in part, he said, because cost estimates are “systematically and significantly deceptive.”" The U.S. used to be ranked first in the world in the quality of its infrastructure. Now it is ranked 13th. "“If people knew the real cost from the start, nothing would ever be approved. The idea is to get going. Start digging a hole and make it so big there’s no alternative to coming up with the money to fill it in.”" "“All the major projects have cost and schedule issues,” he acknowledged. “The truth is these are very high-risk and difficult projects. Conditions change. It is impossible to estimate it accurately. That is naïve.”" "The environmental review process has become so complex, in part to defend against inevitable lawsuits, that neither state agencies nor federal departments can write and review the documents without teams of outside consultants."},

Many have generated self-reported emission inventories, but their value to emissions mitigation depends on their accuracy, which remains untested. Here, we compare self-reported inventories from 48 US cities to independent estimates from the Vulcan carbon dioxide emissions data product, which is consistent with atmospheric measurements. We found that cities under-report their own greenhouse gas emissions, on average, by 18.3{\%} (range: −145.5{\%} to +63.5{\%}) -- a difference which if extrapolated to all U.S. cities, exceeds California's total emissions by 23.5{\%}. Differences arise because city inventories omit particular fuels and source types and estimate transportation emissions differently. These results raise concerns about self-reported inventories in planning or assessing emissions, and warrant consideration of the new urban greenhouse gas information system recently developed by the scientific community.},

% "“It would be very easy for us to just say, ‘We did a survey and 75 percent of Oaklanders say they support Slow Streets,’” Mr. Russo said. “When you see the fact that it’s disproportionately folks who are higher-income who really enjoy it, and people who are white who are saying that, that’s a very important thing for government to be listening to.” Those survey response rates echo research on public meetings about development, conducted by the political scientists Katherine Levine Einstein, David Glick and Maxwell Palmer. The people who show up for such meetings, thus shaping what kind of housing is built, tend to be older, whiter, higher-income and homeowners.  Those are the people with more time for public meetings, the flexibility to show up on a weeknight, and motivation to do so. They also wield the most power when they speak, with their homeowner’s concerns about property values at stake, or with their credentials as engineers, architects or lawyers who have read the zoning code."

% "“Participation processes are broken in two different ways,” said Professor Einstein, who teaches at Boston University. “They’re weaponized by privileged white people. And then when less privileged communities do try to use them, they’re not as effective as a tool for them.” Jeremy Levine, a sociologist who spent several years following community meetings in poorer neighborhoods of Boston, found that those meetings often served to give officials and developers the power to say “the community” is on board.  “More meetings, better-attended meetings or differently designed meetings will not alleviate these fundamental challenges,” said Mr. Levine, a professor at the University of Michigan.  This is the reality as cities consider what it would mean to have more community input: In city planning, participatory democracy has largely increased inequality, not lessened it."

Until the 1980s most street treest were big elms, which were inset pollinated. But most of these male trees that have replaced them since dutch elm disease are wind pollinated. Despite what you read about pollen blowing hundreds of miles, most pollen lands close by to wear it originated. Trees also do pull polutants out of the environment - and incorporate them into the tree, and males put them back out as pollen which is inhaled by humans (while females would drop pollutants in seeds, which would not be eaten by humans). This is known as botanical sexism.},

  comment={Sim City's algorithms were largely based on the theories put forth by Jay Forrester in his 1969 book Urban Dynamics. Forrester had built an early city simulator based on 150 equiations and 200 parameters. The simulator found that once the land area of a city was used up and the only way to grow was by replacing already existing structures, his simulated cities went into inevitable decline. This (unfortunately) matched what people were seeing with the urban crises of the 60s and 70s. Built into the models was classist assumptions, like the poor had higher birth rates, made fewer contributions to taxes, and increased public expenditures. (In addition, it was vastly oversimplified - almost to the point of an "outsider" like vision of cities.) Forrester was careful to not claim his simulations reflected particular cities, but made generalizations about cities in general. He claimed that programs aimed at helping the underemployed - particularly low-income housing - cost public resources and occupied land that could be more productively used for other thigns. Forrester's simulations gave a theoretical backing to conservative notions of "benign neglect" (ala Daniel Patrick Moynihan) hands-off urban policies. Forrester felt that throughout human history people have had a simplistic cause-and-effect approach to policy making based on our simplistic "mental models", but our social interactions are far more complex and we can't hold them in our heads. Because of that, he felt that the effects of social programs would be different than those imagined by policymakers. The intuitive solutions are "wrong most of the time". Things we do to try to improve society are likely to backfire. This is, of course, totally a conservative notion. Albert O. Hirschman calls this the "perversity thesis" and identifies it throughout history. Where a conservative speaker can claim they share your social goal, while simultaneasly arguing that your approach will only make it worse. ``Expert knowledge, of course, has an important place in democratic deliberation, but it can also cut people out of the policy process, dampen the urgency of moral claims, and program a sense of powerlessness into our public discourse. Appeals to a social system’s “complexity” and the potential for “perverse outcomes” can be enough to sink transformative social programs that are still on the drawing board. This might not matter in the context of a virtual environment like that of  Urban Dynamics or SimCity, but we have decades of real-world evidence that demonstrates the disastrous costs of the “counterintuitive” anti-welfare agenda. Straightforward solutions to poverty and economic misery—redistribution and  the provision of public services—have both empirical backing and moral force. Maybe it’s time we start listening to our intuition again. ''},

% This is such an interesting observation, but the causes are SO much more complicated than just the corporatization of retail or expensive real estate. Rich people - the shoppers - simply aren't as sophisticated as they used to be (or think they are). And the internet combined with fast-fashion has democratized what is cutting edge in terms of fashion and style. Being rich no longer entitles you to first access to new and inspiring styles - it just entitles you expensive styles. Similarly "luxury" items are no longer strongly correlated with well-made things or a rarefied aesthetic, they are just correlated with cost. One luxury car is basically indistinguishable from another nowadays. One luxury apartment looks just like the next.  
% Instead, the truly beautiful, the new, and the culture-defining belong to the people who have the vision to seek them out, from the deepest corners of the internet and the dankest corners of upstate thrift stores. This is as it should be - let the rich rot with their bleached and boring overpriced and underwhelming junk.

previous estimates, and that nearly 41 million Americans live within the 1% annual exceedance probability floodplain (compared to only 13 million when calculated using FEMA flood maps).

This is not radically different from other unsuccessful attempts at utopians cities built from the ground up --- which generally fail spectacularly. There is some arguments that many of the things that the tech dreamers want are similar to what urbanists want --- transit connections, affordable housing, dense walkable mixed neighborhoods. But the technologists want to solve the problems through engineering and technology, rather than fixing our current cities though politics. The technologists prize "first principles" --- the idea that breaking new ground opens new solutions, and also implies that historical awareness and traditional expertise can be limiting. They equate their ideas with early radical ideas about cities, like grids. And they suggest maybe all the rules of a city could fit in 100 pages. This article points out that urban planning utopias are not the only thing that failed, but even within technology planning has failed in the past --- NASA tried to get into the planning game back in the 1960s, thinking that their groundbreaking technologies in space exploration could be applied to all sorts of fields. ``Technologically optimized cities, he says, failed then for the same reason they would be unsuccessful now. Technology can help reduce traffic, or connect you faster to a ride home. “But a city is not at its fundamental level optimizable,” he said. A city’s dynamism derives from its inefficiencies, from people and ideas colliding unpredictably. It’s also unclear what you’d optimize an entire city for.

  comment={Painted in broad simple strokes, Krugman outlines the dichotomy between Houston's no-regulation environment and how it contributed to the flooding disaster of Hurricane Harvey, and San Francisco's NIMBYist environment and how it contributes to the affordable housing crisis for low-income workers. Krugman points out that this is one of the few places where he agrees with the "both sides get it wrong" philosophy. He points out the San Francisco and Houston are extreme examples, but not that extreme in that many of the aspects that those cities represent are reflected in other major coastal cities versus southern sunbelt cities. Namely that there is nearly no regulation in the sunbelt cities, and NIMBYism prevents nearly anything from being done in the coastal elite cities.},  
  category={Urbanism, sunbelt cities, hurricane harvey, nimby, san franscico, houston, affordable housing}  
}  
% Mostly I'm with Krugman in criticising NIMBYism, but there is an element to this where he is being both too much of an economist and too much focussed on the individual issue of affordable housing, rather than overall affordability of cities.   
% On econmics because I know fundamentally he believes in the basic supply and demand issue of housing, where if more housing is built at any price range, housing becomes cheaper overall. This has been proven wrong time and again in the real world, but it doesn't stop economists from believing it.  
% And the affordability of housing in those elite coastal cities is off-set to a large degree (though usually not entirely) by lower transportation costs. If you take into account the ability to live in NYC without owning a car, the affordability of the city dives into the average range.  
% See also this in-depth article on the same subject: \url{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/11/climate/houston-flooding-climate.html}  
``the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes.  The problem is that hurricanes and floods, worsened by climate change, do not recognize political borders or county lines. Their toll is shared by everyone.''  
``But what does “affordable” really mean if residents have to pay hefty transportation costs and rebuild, time and again, after floods? Houston’s affordability leans on loosely regulated, low-cost immigrant labor providing an abundance of cheaply made, slab-on-grade, single-family houses that sprawl on all that open land, in areas like the Katy Prairie.  And it relies heavily on American taxpayers providing government tax credits, mortgage interest deductions, gas subsidies, artificially low flood insurance rates, highway construction money — and emergency relief, including buying out homeowners to remove their properties from harm’s way.''

One of the problems is that generally whether the taxpayers foot the bill in a payment to a contractor, or a private company collects tolls to make money, the cost burden still falls on the public. Points out that private companies have different, narrower profit-raising goals from governments, which are thinking more broadly and in terms of wider benefits. Has examples of onerous agreements that governments went into with private companies that made it cheaper to build something, but prevented governments from expanding in the smartest way later.

% What he doesn't make clear is the ratio of sprawl versus growth. One could argue that places with space to spread out are doing so BECAUSE of increased urbanization. So it still COULD BE a back-to-the-city movement in those places, but with a lack of transit the only option to reach an affordable living situation is by car, and so people hit the suburbs. It may be they don't WANT the suburbs, but are forced there for economic reasons. And they choose that over rural areas because they want to be as close to the city center as they can reasonably afford.  
% In this telling (for which no data is provided here) the city centers might still be growing, but the suburbs grow faster for affordability reasons, making the data look like people are still choosing suburbs over cities. Meanwhile in a place like seattle, people can afford to be where they want to be, and there is transit, so the city center grows.

It's the fact that they are WHITE that might actually make it seem safe for the rich, before the crime rate actually drops.

  comment={A nice little history of ``urban renewal'' and all the problems associated with it. ``Urban renewal was fundamentally about places, not people — and the people in the way of redeveloping those places were often scattered to other slums or housing they could not afford. Seldom were they welcomed back to what was built in place of their homes. And less than 1 percent of all federal spending for urban renewal between 1949 and 1964 went to relocation, Mr. Gans wrote.'' ``Four units of low-income housing were destroyed for every one new unit that was built. And more than two-thirds of the displaced were black or Hispanic, a pattern that was clear by 1963 when the author James Baldwin observed that urban renewal “means Negro removal.”'' ``The psychologist Marc Fried, studying the same West End community, later documented the severe grief those residents experienced after they lost their homes. They lived through what the Columbia researcher Mindy Fullilove has today eloquently named “root shock.” Pull people from their communities, she argues, and they experience trauma not unlike what happens when you uproot a plant.''},

This wisdom assumes, unrealistically, that city sites are homogeneous, migration is unfettered, land is given freely to incoming migrants, and federal taxes are neutral. Should those assumptions not hold, large cities may be inefficiently small. We prove this claim in a system of cities with heterogeneous sites and either free mobility or local governments, where  agglomeration economies, congestion, federal taxation, and land ownership create wedges. A quantitative version of our model suggests that cities may well be too numerous and underpopulated for a wide range of plausible parameter values. The welfare costs of free migration equilibria appear small, whereas they seem substantial when local governments control city size.},

  comment={An excellent easy to understand overview of the modifiable unit area problem (MUAP) and problems with measuring density. Makes the argument that it isn't density per se that is good about cities but some of the aspects of density. References research that shows that happily living in a city is having a good commute and being able to easily get to all the things you need for living (post office, church, library, grocery store, restaurant, bar, cafe). This can be achieved in small towns if things are close together. Also: ``But it isn’t just convenience and transportation efficiency that draws so many of today’s urbanists to prize density. They point to the ways that density nurtures both innovation and social diversity to argue that there are fundamental “agglomeration effects” which result from gathering people and businesses together in close proximity. There’s certainly something to this: the geographer Waldo Tobler’s famous “first law of geography” states that “near things are more related than distant things,” and we are undoubtedly more likely to participate in both acts of social solidarity and economic interchange with people who are close at hand than with those who are far distant.  But it’s naïve to assume that all people have equal access to one another just because they happen to be bumping shoulders—a fantasy bred in the cozy atmosphere of elite college campuses and well-decorated coffeehouses. In reality, our social and economic interactions are highly stratified by barriers like race, gender, education, and class.''},

But there is a darker side to it. The urban village ethos has encouraged prosperous neighborhoods to turn inward and even take pride in not connecting with fellow citizens in the suburban areas beyond.'' ``The language we still hold on to about the inner city disguises the changes that have taken place. We still invoke the social justice battles of urban neighborhoods of the past — community, environment, heritage, people power — in an endless war to fight for even greater advantages for ourselves.'' ``The challenge for our city and many like it is to think beyond the urban villages. The passion for well-designed communities needs to be directed outward instead of inward, geographically and in spirit. We need to let go of some of our resources; we need to learn to share. And if we are going to fight for our perfect little villages, the most honorable fight is the one to retain and expand public housing, to keep what little diversity we have left.''},

In Paris, the poor are banished beyond the périphérique so that when they revolt, they destroy their own banlieues rather than the French capital’s fussily maintained environment.'' ``Manhattan island is today a pristine vitrine on which the lower orders don’t even get to leave their mucky paw prints, but inside which the rich get to fulfil with unparallelled freedom their uninteresting desires.'' ``The point of the cities Benjamin loved, by contrast, was that they broke through physical, ethnic and class barriers. In Marseille, Naples and Moscow, life was not a private commodity, but “dispersed, porous, commingled”.''},

% This article is written as if this is a problem that reflects conditions from 100 years ago. But that is probably a European thing. In NYC it is a problem reflecting conditions from the 70s.  
% Also, without having read any of the Benjamin itself, this does make it seem like Benjamin was more or less a dude coming from a wealthy background enjoying the pleasures of slumming it. Maybe this is unusual at the level of slumming a whole CITY and an in-depth philosophical, anti-capitalist argument, but the impulse hardly seems different than bros hitting up dive bars for cheap beer.

Yet understanding the variety of these forms can help stakeholders make wise choices regarding how to plan and design urban regions in the future to meet goals such as livability and sustainability. Based on aerials, maps, and images available through Google and other sources, I develop a typology of built landscape forms found within 24 metropolitan regions worldwide and use GIS to map these forms and compare regions. The analysis shows that 27 basic types of built landscape make up metropolitan regions worldwide, of which nine are very common. Traditional urban types now make up a small fraction of most metropolitan areas worldwide, while suburban and exurban forms comprise the vast majority of the land area. There are noted regional differences in the mix of built landscape types.Takeaway for practice: Each built landscape form offers challenges and opportunities for planning objectives such as livability and sustainability. It is important for planners to a) help the public and decision makers understand built landscapes and their implications; b) include landscape-scale elements, such as street patterns and networks of green infrastructure, when framing urban development alternatives; c) ensure that local codes and design guidelines enable desired forms of built landscapes and discourage those that are problematic for sustainability; and d) encourage built landscape change that promotes sustainability. },

This paper examines these questions within a model of recombinant growth and endogenous local amenities. Three primary factors determine the trade-off between networks and big cities: local returns to scale in innovation, the elasticity of housing supply, and the importance of local amenities. Even if there are global increasing returns, the returns to local scale in innovation may be decreasing, and that makes networks more appealing than mega-cities. Inelastic housing supply makes it harder to supply more space in dense confines, which perhaps explains why networks are more popular in regulated Europe than in the American Sunbelt. Larger cities can dominate networks because of amenities, as long as the benefits of scale overwhelm the downsides of density. In our framework, the skilled are more likely to prefer mega-cities than the less skilled, and the long-run benefits of either mega-cities or networks may be quite different from the short-run benefits.},

The trend goes back to at least the 1840s, but grew particularly strong during the middle decades of the 20th century.'' ``starting in the early 1980s, the long trend toward regional equality abruptly switched. Since then, geography has come roaring back as a determinant of economic fortune, as a few elite cities have surged ahead of the rest of the country in their wealth and income.'' ``But over the last generation this trend, too, has reversed. Since 1980, the states and metro areas with the highest and fastest-growing per capita incomes have generally seen hardly, if any, net domestic in-migration, and in many notable examples have seen more people move away to other parts of the country than move in. Today, the preponderance of domestic migration is from areas with high and rapidly growing incomes to relatively poorer areas where incomes are growing at a slower pace, if at all.'' ``Throughout most of the country’s history, American government at all levels has pursued policies designed to preserve local control of businesses and to check the tendency of a few dominant cities to monopolize power over the rest of the country. These efforts moved to the federal level beginning in the late 19th century and reached a climax of enforcement in the 1960s and ’70s. Yet starting shortly thereafter, each of these policy levers were flipped, one after the other, in the opposite direction, usually in the guise of “deregulation.” Understanding this history, largely forgotten today, is essential to turning the problem of inequality around.'' Mostly we are talking about anti-trust regulations and anti-big-chain-store regulations of the 20s and 30s, led by Woodrow Wilson and Louis Brandeis, which prevented wealth from concentrating in big cities.

Tissot draws on years of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews, as well as historical material on the South End (much of which appears in fascinating boxed-text asides), to demonstrate how culture was used as a cudgel in a protracted battle of neighborhood realpolitik.'' ``Tissot implies that these gentrifiers, in prioritizing upper-middle-class, white prerogatives, did not just disagree over the proper uses of public spaces but were specifically drawn to concerns that privileged their cultural knowledge and maintained them in a position of prominence.'' ``Good Neighbors powerfully demonstrates how gentrifiers often fixate on the old (homes) and the marginally political (greenmarkets) so that they do not have to think about the displacement involved in neighborhood change and their own role in it.'' ``Newcomers endeavor to project a relaxed and egalitarian nature by working through civic groups rather than more formal channels of institutional and state power (although these are always there if they need them). Yet within these groups they create many barriers for participation: from inconvenient meeting times to all-but-mandatory large donations and discussions held in a language of corporate-speak and legalese.''},

  Title={Is Gentrification Really a Problem?},  
  journal={The New Yorker},  
  date={2016-07-11},  
  comment={Discusses the use of the word `ghetto' to mean something bad. And how ``The opposite of gentrification is not a quirky and charming enclave that stays affordable forever; the opposite of gentrification is a decline in prices that reflects the transformation of a once desirable neighborhood into one that is looking more like a ghetto every day.'' Also covers how, while in NYC poor black neighborhoods might be likely to gentrify, this isn't (yet) the case in other places, like Chicago.  ``Do tenants have a political right—a human right—to remain in their apartments? In New York, regulations like rent stabilization not only limit the amount by which some landlords can raise rents but also restrict a landlord’s ability to decline to renew a lease. In Sweden, the rules are tighter: rents are set through a national negotiation between tenants and landlords, which means that prices are low in Stockholm, but apartments are scarce; a renter in search of a long-term lease there might spend decades on a government waiting list. Another solution is to allow more and taller buildings, increasing supply in the hope of lowering prices. Often, the steepest rent increases are found in places, like San Francisco, that have stringent building regulations: a recent study of the city found that fewer poor residents had been displaced in neighborhoods with more new construction. In seeking to preserve what Ruth Glass called the “social character” of a neighborhood, anti-gentrification activists echo the language that was once used to defend racially restrictive covenants. Arguments over gentrification are really arguments over who deserves to live in a city, and the notion of a right to stay put is sometimes at odds with another, perhaps more fundamental right: the right to move.'' ``In the ghetto narrative, a poor neighborhood falls victim to isolation; in the gentrification narrative, a poor neighborhood falls victim to invasion. These stories are not necessarily contradictory—they reflect a common conviction that the sorrows and joys of neighborhood change tend to be unequally shared. One effect of gentrification is to make this inequality harder to ignore. The call to save a neighborhood is most compelling when it serves as a call to help a neighborhood’s neediest inhabitants. That might mean helping them stay. But it might also mean helping them leave.''},  
  category={Urbanism}  
}  
% Refers to the freeman2005displacement paper as evidence that gentrification doesn't impact poor households negatively. He backs this up with another bit of research by Kathe Newman and Elvin Wyly called The Right to Stay Put Revisited, which finds displacement is a problem, but maybe a mild one.

abstract ={Urban scholars have described the importance of gentrification in major cities across the USA since the 1970s. While there is consensus that gentrification shaped social and physical aspects of neighbourhoods, scholars have yet to agree on how gentrified neighbourhoods should be identified. Owing to the lack of consensus, gentrification was measured in a variety of ways, which greatly influenced the neighbourhoods studied in previous research and potentially the findings of research that assessed the importance of gentrification for other neighbourhood outcomes. The current study contributes to this debate by applying and comparing two census-based strategies for identifying gentrified neighbourhoods with a qualitative neighbourhood selection strategy derived from The New York Times to New York City neighbourhoods for the span of years from 1980 to 2009. Results confirm that each of the strategies identified different neighbourhoods and that qualitative strategies for identifying gentrified neighbourhoods may overlook areas that experienced similar changes to those more widely recognised as gentrified. Given these findings, additional analyses assessed which census-based neighbourhood selection strategy better represented the neighbourhoods perceived by The New York Times, a major media outlet that shaped discourse on gentrification in the USA, as having experienced gentrification.},

Some of these areas began as “suburbs within the city” in the 1800s and early 1900s and have maintained their positions atop the neighborhood hierarchy thanks to their appeal to a subset of high-income households.'' ``New York stands out from most other cities in that so many of its top households live in the middle of the central city. These super-rich neighborhoods — which spread into previously affordable areas, giving rise to much recent debate on gentrification — form the densest concentration of affluence in the United States, eclipsing the smaller privileged areas that have recently gentrified in Boston and DC.'' ``The productivity and higher costs of big CZs do not translate to higher incomes, education levels, and housing values in their bottom tracts. If anything, conditions in the bottom tracts are a little better on average in the smaller CZs — measured on this national scale — than in larger ones. The processes that add up to clustering by affluent households in privileged neighborhoods may therefore be leaving disadvantaged people behind in distressed neighborhoods.''},
