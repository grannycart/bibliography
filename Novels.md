% First, this book is not great. It's shocking that they made so many generations of ELA students read it (still read it?). The simple fact that it is about children (boys, exclusively) does not save it from being rather dull. There's a lot of imprecise description of not much, and the language is capable but not interesting. Overall a slow, boring book which feels much longer than it is because so little actually happens.  
% But, my question going into this book was: is this book not actually about some fear of the "savage" within all of us (as was generally taught in ELA, I suppose) but actually specifically (if unconsciously) about the British fear of their own colonies. And, though it takes a while to get there (the first full half of the book is basically just the boys setting up camp) this is clearly the case. Some evidence:  
    % First, the whole setup is ridiculous. I don't think children (even in the cowboys and indians 50s) would set up "tribes" with "chiefs" if left to themselves. What's with all the assemblies and meetings? That sounds more like what adults would do than children. And Ralph has this obsession with shelter, which is clearly supposed to represent his trying to guide the boys back to some form of civilization. Supposedly they need them because of the coming rain. But it's a tropical island. If it rains, so what? And indeed, when it does rain, it passes within a few hours with no mention of the shelter being of any use at all.  
	% Then Ralph starts repeatedly forgetting why they want to build a signal fire (to be rescued, Piggy has to keep reminding him), as if the forces of becoming "savage" are like some kind of magic or disease that takes over your brain without the correcting influence of civilization. Page 148: "Ralph tried indignantly to remember. There was something good about a fire" Somehow this is a common assumption about "going native" --- that one forgets where they came from. Keep the River on Your Right does the same thing (almost) when he bites a human heart. But it's pretty unconvincing. (And in Schneebaum's case, a convenient cover.)    
	% The notion that inside every good English choir boy is a savage was, I think, at the time this book was written something that would be thought to transcend racism: it's not about a _specific_ "savage" race, but that "savages" are the lower form of man to which anyone might revert if given the opportunity. What's amazing is that this (probably) _wasn't_ seen as racist --- how could they miss that, really? Clearly, the idea "savage" cultures are a lower form of man is deeply racist. The idea that people revert to "savage" without the influence of civilization is just stupid. This is the core failure of the book: the whole thing rests on a stupid idea.  
		% Ralph and Piggy can't help but partake in the dance of murdering Simon: Page 138: "They were glad to touch the brown backs of the fence that hemmed in the terror and made it governable."  
		% The "dance" is considered "obscene" (as any white person would say about the dance of "savages"). Page 144: "Sam twisted and the obscene word shot out of him. '---dance'."  
		% Jack gets the idea to sacrifice the head of hunted pigs to the beast (page 146). As if sacrifice to gods was just a built-in part of human identity that we could revert to at any time without the influence of Christianity and civilization.  
        % Similarly, Jack gets the boys wearing face paint, also as if it is built in to "lower level" human activity: page 157: "They understood only too well the liberation into savagery that the concealing paint brought." --- The boys are literally afraid of what the face paint does to them.  
% So far, this is all to the argument that the idea that humans slip back to "savagery" is racist and stupid --- an easy target to hit. But how does it weigh on the idea that this book is about the British fear of their colonies? That might be less explicit, and even more of a thing that was a deep part of mid-Century British culture than a conscious topic of thought for Golding. It's unlikely that Golding even had any access at all to that idea. But the idea of "savage" comes directly from the previous centuries of exposure that the British had to other cultures through their quest for empire. ie the British only even can think of what a savage is because they knew so many of them through conquest --- and crucially through trying to spread "civilization". As a result, they defined their whole culture in opposition to being "savage." So Golding is writing a horror novel: your own children could with the slightest provocation sink into the savagery we have spent so much money and effort fighting for the last 200 years.   
		% Jack becomes a tyrant, and Ralph assimilates "the possibilities of irresponsible authority." (page 145) The idea being that responsible authority of civilization is good, savage authority of "chiefs" is irresponsible.  
% The central fright of the book (and, I suspect, essentially the only reason the book was so popular) is Golding saying that all of us have a "savage" inside that we could give in to in the right circumstances. ('Even little British boys Mr. Golding? Yes, even British boys ma'am!') This idea is a true horror to the British reading public, since they were so convinced by Victoria that they had created the world's greatest "civilization". Golding of course believed that the savage was in all human, not just the British. But now we can look back and see first, how ridiculous that idea is. And second, that what is really going on is the British were afraid of all the 'savages' they colonized rising up to form a rebellion from within their own psyches. (And that's assuming you are unwilling to read the book as British fear of LITERAL rebellion by their colonies --- something that would have been top of mind when the book was written.)  
    % Page 163: The painted group moved around Samneric nervously and unhandily. Samneric protested out of the heart of civilization: "Oh, I say!" "---Honestly!"  
    % Page 164: Piggy's final speech: "Which is better---to be pack of painted indians like you are, or to be sensible like Ralph is?" "Which is better---to have rules and agree, or to hunt and kill?" "Which is better, law and rescue, or hunting and breaking things up?"  
    % Page 167: He even glimpsed one of them, striped brown, black, and red, and had judged that it was Bill. But really, thought Ralph, this was not Bill. This was a savage whose image refused to blend with that ancient picture of a boy in shorts and shirt.  
    % The force of savagery within (according to Golding) makes you stupid as well as savage. Page 179: There was no solemn assembly for debate nor dignity of the conch. Most, he was beginning to dread the curtain that might waiver in his brain, blacking out the sense of danger, making a simpleton out of him.  
    % And at the end of the book, when the naval officer sees them, full conversion to "savages," in that the boys now look like the people that the British have colonized (crucially for the argument that this book is racist, this includes skin color). Page 183: Other boys began appearing now, tiny tots some of them, brown, with the distended bellies of small savages. One of them came close to the officer and looked up. "I'm, I'm---" But there was no more to come. Percival Wemys Madison sought in his head for an incantation that had faded clean away.  
    % The officer has to check that they boys are actually British because he is so disbelieving. Page 184: "I should have thought that a pack of British boys---you're all British, aren't you---would have been able to put up a better show than that."  
% What's absolutely clear is this is NOT a book that should be taught in schools (even with an extremely critical reading, it's also just dull). It never should have been. Though if you try to google this stuff, mostly you get reports about how conservative religious groups often tried to ban the book because of swear words, violence, devil worship, and promoting anarchy (I wish!). It is difficult to find discussion of the colonial racist aspects of the book but this appears to be one academic article that does it:

% Classic modern spy novel. Except it's more of a courtroom drama than a spy novel, as most of the climax happens in a communist military court.
% I didn't like the way it ended. The twist is great, but he has Mundt -- the former Nazi who is also London's secret agent in communist Germany -- kill off the main characters in the last few lines of the book. This doesn't really makes sense, because Mundt is the one who frees them military prison. This is explained away unconvincingly in a line of dialog, but really it seems like if Mundt wanted them dead, he would have left them to be executed. I guess Mundt actually wanted the girl, Liz, dead, and he had her killed going over the wall? That sort of makes sense.  
% Still, I think I would have had Liz leave Leamas (the main character) because of all his lies, and leave them both to live on with the guilty knowledge that they inadvertently helped save a terrible Nazi dude just because he happened to work for the British government. They wrestle with that, but it would have been more interesting, I think, if they had to _live_ with that.

% Perhaps it is the best translation -- for instance I found the Waterloo diversion much more enteretaining than when I read it in the previous version in college.  
% Still, sure is long. The story is so good, but the diversions can be brutal (many really should be skipped). The translator adds a bunch of notes that don't really add much and the temptation to read them really slows things down.

% This book is in many ways the complement to Blood Meridian. Where Blood Meridian is about pure evil unleashed on the Old West, this book is about how there is no evil (or good) in the Old West, just people. Some people are better than others, but all believe they are acting in the interest of being decent, even the black-hat cattle rustlers and murderers. So events unfold in a way that the motivations for revenge are based on misinterpretations of events. Or driven by public opinion that is derived from false assumptions. Or by people who have something to prove, or legitimate beefs that need to be settled regardless of the law (like being accused of murder that someone didn't commit). More than once, someone gets killed by accident, and that gets interpreted as murder by the townspeople and that leads to fallout of more gun battles.  
% The overall theme is that the things that motivate people are very complex, but rarely or never actually evil.  
% See page 255, where Gannon (the former rustler/murderer who has become deputy with a sense of trying to do right) points out that a man who has been told he cannot come into town or he will be shot, comes to town anyway, perhaps to _get_ shot, and by doing so atone for things that he had done wrong in the past.  
% Page 443: Morgan's last stand. Awesome because Morgan goes out shooting up the town, trying to draw Blaisedell out. At the same time he KNOWS it's an act. He isn't serious about what he's doing, he is just causing a ruckus to create a situation Blaisedell will have to respond to. A fine example of how the motivations in this book are all twisted up and indirect.

% This book (and presumably this book is representative of all Terry Pratchett) is just exhausting to read. You don't think you would miss chapter breaks until you don't have them. The cadence of the monty-python-style jokes is hilarious in small doses, but when it just goes on and on without a breath it's extremely tiring. And Monty Python has a kind of intelligence behind the jokes, whereas Pratchett seems to just revel in a kinda-dumb kinda-funny British turn-of-phrase. It also has this quality of having been written in one long session without going back to change anything afterward. For instance, he clearly came up with the joke about the "rank" part of rank-and-file about half-way through the book, and then uses it for the rest of the book but never thought that maybe that should be either a one-off or consistent throughout the whole book. Still, it is actually funny in a way that makes me wish I had read Terry Pratchett when I was 15 because I would have thought it was hilarious then, and now I would have nostalgia that overrides the weaknesses. It's not _terrible_, but at this point in my reading career it is also not nearly satisfying enough to keep me reading Pratchett's dozens and dozens of novels.

% I suspect most of these stories are suffering from lost-in-translation. They are heavily philosophical, and I believe the concepts are not coming across well. As a result, most of the stories are pretty dull.

% In the Pupil: This story is about how a woman's eyes are litterally man-traps: the little man you see in them gets stuck in there.  
% 'Yellow Coal' is the stand-out story in this collection, head and shoulders above the rest. (I do not understand why I have not seen it mentioned in any of the write-ups, reviews, or introduction to this book.) Humanity has consumed all its energy resources and in a desperate attempt to fuel the world's industries an inventor comes up with a way to power things on pure human hatred/spite. As a result governments start policies to create anger (narrowing doorways, crowded trams) and encourage hatred between classes and countries, and even between individuals (between wife and husband). Industry flourished under this new power, and eventually realize they can power factories by firing people and causing strikes. BE ANGRY OR GO HUNGRY becomes the motto. Eventually all the human bile is used up, and power starts to run down despite all efforst to make people angry, resulting in the lack of ability to satirize the situation.

(Not least because they put Marco --- the guy who knows he has been brainwashed --- in charge of investigating the brainwashing.

% There is a strong temptation to read Trump into this book, since it is about a populist demagogue. But Willie Stark is of the brilliant Machiavellian type: power for power's sake, controlling through deft manipulation and outsmarting the opposition. It is more like a novelization of The Power Broker than a warning of Trumpism. Trump, possibly uniquely among American demagogues, seems to me like a total moron who happened to luck into a political moment where the white working class is so desperate for change that they will take anything he does --- even things that would be considered career-ending mistakes by a Willie Stark character from the past --- as simply another signal of how anti-establishment he is. This is, of course, idiocy on the part of the public because, outside of crass language, Trump is about as anti-establishment as the Lincoln Memorial. Point is: it's a mistake to see Trump in Willie Stark, other than his riding to power on the support of hicks.   
% Page 9: It was always that way. There was the bulge and the glitter, and there was the cold grip way down in the stomach as though some- body had laid hold of something in there, in the dark which is you, with a cold hand in a cold rubber glove. It was like the second when you come home late at night and see the yellow envelope of the telegram sticking out from under your door and you lean and pick it up, but don’t open it yet, not for a second. While you stand there in the hall, with the envelope in your hand, you feel there’s an eye on you, a great big eye looking straight at you from miles and dark and through walls and houses and through your coat and vest and hide and sees you huddled up way inside, in the dark which is you, inside yourself, like a clammy, sad little foetus you carry around inside yourself. The eye knows what’s in the envelope, and it is watching you to see you when you open it and know, too.  But the clammy, sad little foetus which is you way down in the dark which is you too lifts up its sad little face and its eyes are blind, and it shivers cold inside you for it doesn’t want to know what is in that envelope. It wants to lie in the dark and not know, and be warm in its not-knowing. The end of man is knowledge, but there is one thing he can’t know. He can’t know whether knowledge will save him or kill him. He will be killed, all right, but he can’t know whether he is killed because of the knowledge which he has got or because of the knowledge which he hasn’t got and which if he had it, would save him. There’s the cold in yotir stomach, but you open the envelope, you have to open the envelope, for the end of man is to know.  
% Page 34: Her face seemed to smooth itself out and relax with an inner faith in happiness the way the face of the chief engineer does when he goes down to the engine room at night and the big wheel is blurred out with its speed and the pistons plunge and re- turn and the big steel throws are leaping in their perfect orbits like a ballet, and the whole place, under the electric glare, hums and glitters and sings like the eternal insides of God's head, and the 5hip is knocking off twenty-two knots on a glassy, starlit sea.

The roar would swell and rise and fall and swell again, with the Boss standing with his right arm raised straight to Heaven and his red eyes bulging.  And when the roar fell away, he said, with his arm up, “I have looked in your faces!" And they would yell.  And he said, “O Lord, and I have seen a sign!” And they would yell again.  And he said, "I have seen dew on the fleece and the ground dry! Then the yell. Then, “I have seen blood on the moon!” Then, ‘'Buckets of blood, and boy! I know whose blood it will be.” Then, leaning forward, grabbing out with his right hand as though to seize something in the air before him, “Gimme that meat ax!”   
% Page 152: I knew, too, how the newspapers would regard that crowd of people, as soon as they knew the end of the event. They would regard that crowd as cause. “A shameful display of cowardice on the part of the Legislature . . . allow themselves to be intimidated by . . .  deplorable lack of leadership . . ." You could look at the crowd out there and hear that undertone in its cry, hoarse like surf, and think that the crowd there could cause the event. But no, it could be said, Willie Stark caused the event by corrupting and blackmailing the Legislature. But no, in turn it could be replied that Willie Stark merely gave the Legislature the opportunity to behave in the way appropriate to its nature and that MacMurfee, who sponsored the election of those men, thinking to use their fear and greed for ms own ends, was truly responsible. But no, to that it could be replied that the responsibility belonged, after all, to that crowd of people, indirectly in so far as it had allowed MacMurfee to elect such men, and directly in so far as it had, despite MacMurfee, elected Willie Stark. But why had they elected Willie Stark? Because of a complex of forces which had made them what they were, or because Willie Stark could lean toward them with bulging eyes and right arm raised to Heaven?   
	% This above is one of the best single paragraphs of analysis of what's wrong with democracy that I have ever read.  
% If you ever do a re-read, skip Chapter 7. The whole chapter is a flashback to build up the relationship with Anne Stanton and the narrator (so you understand why the narrator is so upset when she sleeps with Willie Stark). But it is super boring. I think because it tries to lay on a huge amount of meaning to a relationship between people who are essentially teenagers --- and never sleep together. It may have worked in the 40s, but by today's standards it's hard to get on board with the idea that a chaste teenage summer fling creates feelings that last a lifetime (for both parties). Written today, the book would have been better to just drop this chapter entirely, and leave the strength of his feelings for Anne Stanton unspoken.  
% Page 328: Half the people in the state knew that the Boss had been tom-catting around for years, but the pictures of the family' and the white leghorns gave the voters a nice warm glow, it made them feel solid, substantial, and virtuous, it made them think of gingerbread and nice cold buttermilk, and if somewhere not too far in the wings there was a flicker of a black-lace negligee and a whiff of musky perfume, then, 'Well, you cain't blame him a-taken hit, they put hit up to him.' It only meant that the Boss was having it both ways, and that seemed a mark of the chosen and superior. It was what the voter did when he shook loose and came up to town to the furniture dealers' convention and gave the bellhop a couple of bucks to get him a girl up to the room. Or if he wasn't doing it classy, he rode into town with his truckload of hogs and for two bucks got the whole works down at a crib. But either way, classy or crib, the voter knew what it meant, and he wanted both Mom's gingerbread and the black-lace negligee and didn't hold it against the Boss for having both.
	% I think this is a thing that those in power don't understand about Trump. Trump supporters _like_ that he fools around, because they secretly aspire to that themselves. That's why Access Hollywood did nothing. It was an element people liked about Kennedy too. I think Obama could have benefited from some rumors of dalliances, as he did from the common but quiet knowledge that he smoked.  
% Page 435: This has been the story of Willie Stark, but it is my story, too.  For I have a story. It is the story of a man who lived in the world and to him the world looked one way for a long time and then it looked another and very different way. The change did not happen all at once. Many things happened, and that man did not know when he had any responsibility for them and when he did not.  There was, in fact, a time when he came to believe that nobody had any responsibility for anything and there was no god but the Great Twitch.

% Just awful. This book suffers from the same thing modern movies do: it relies on you just accepting huge canned cliches to tell its story. Like modern movies, character development is just taken for granted: "he was a poet" is the entire development for one supporting character. Other characters don't even get names, instead she comes up with a mechanism where people are referred to by the instrument they play -- but only minor characters, more major ones still have names. Derivative in all ways, even the fundamental premise of the book is assumed: a pandemic wipes out 299 out of 300 people. Of course, this would leave more than a million people alive across the US, and it's not like any of the resources are contaminated. Why would there be a "collapse"? Is it possible that young people (meaning here, the author) have been fed the post-apocalypse scenario so repeatedly their whole lives that they just take it for granted? That they don't understand that the original post-apocalypse premise was based on nuclear destruction contaminating the vast majority of the resources?  
% The book is wholly derivative. But even The Stand (which I would never defend as a _good_ book) left only a few hundred (or was it thousand?) people alive. The "collapse" in The Stand might have been scientifically implausible, but it at least made sense.  God, I complained about The Road being derivative, but this makes The Road seem like it cut wholly new ground in the post-apocalyptic genre.   
% Page 20: "If Hua said there was an epidemic, then empidemic wasn't a strong enough word." Umm, yeah, that word is _pandemic_, which Emily St. John Mandel would learn a few years after this book was published. Maybe that's what she's hinting at? But that's dumb, the character is a paramedic, he would know the difference between an epidemic and a pandemic.  
% Page 20 (next line): "Jeevan was crushed by the sudden certainty that this was it, that this illness Hua was describing was going to be the divide between a before and an after, a line drawn through his life." Ha! You have no idea Emily St. John Mandel!  
% The only thing that really shines in this book is the descriptions of the "Station Eleven" comics that are book-within-book. The vision for "Station Eleven" should have _been_ this book. I know why it isn't: that would make it a (non-serious) sci-fi/fantasy book, and setting the book in the before-and-after of a catastrophe, it's supposed to be a 'serious' novel, grounded in our daily lives that normal (non-nerd) people can relate to. This is bullshit. The result is a tremendously boring book with a few hints at something that could have actually be creative-flight-of-fancy interesting. Modern fiction sucks the life out of stories.

% I guess by 1940s standards the breastfeeding ending (it's the very last lines of the book) was shocking enough that it could bookend a 600 page novel. But it really feels like the ending of a short story (from that time). It kinda leaves the modern reader (that is, me) just wondering: yeah, and then what? It would have been a more enduring ending to make Uncle John floating the dead fetus downstream with the command to go and tell em all the last page of the book, and the breastfeeding could have come slightly earlier. That would have connected the end of the book to events that happen later while still wrapping things up in a satisyfing way. This isn't to tell Steinbeck how to write, just raising the question of whether an author should go for the move that resonates with the culture of the time? Or the one that will be more enduring? And can an auther even know?

% Notable for being a very early example of the modern novel where not much happens because having plot might be suspect of low-browedness.   
% (Death Comes for the Archbishop is, imho, a far superior book.)   
% She chooses the make the narrator a teenage boy, but somehow completely misses the sheer horniness of teenage boys. The whole book is about how hot these immigrant farm girls are, but everyone in town is so chaste that the book has no sex at all in it (at least by page 130). I find this to be incredibly unrealistic. She's willing to include a part about a homeless dude falling into a thresher, but not willing to go there when it comes to boys rolling in the hay with farm girls? Even in 1900, this just doesn't feel real.  
% I guess on one hand I don't think Willa Cather has a grip on just how powerful the hormones that sweep through teenage boys are. And on the other, the novel is _so_ modern in style, that it is easy to forget it was published in 1918. The style of it makes you expect more explicit descriptions of lust (by _more_ explicit here, I mean more than, say, the girls who slap a dude for kissing them). It reads like a novel written at least 50 years later than it actually was, so the expectation to not dance carefully around sex is always in the back of my mind, and maybe that's not fair.  
% Page 118: Despite being written by a woman with very progressive views on the world, it is not immune from dwelling on offensive stereotypes of its time: "It was the soft, amiable Negro voice, like those I remembered from early childhood, with the note of docile subservience in it. He had the Negro head, too: almost no head at all, nothing behind the ears but folds of neck under close-clipped wool. He would have been repulsive if his face had not been so kindly and happy."  
% Page 132: a reference to waking from "first sleep"  
% Page 139-142: Jim describes being bored out of his mind as a young person in this little town. And describes how Tony would have been so much more if her father had not brought them from New York. Suddenly, for all the idyllic country life we've seen so far in the book, now we see the painful absence of the opportunities and vibrancy a city offers.  
% If you want to be amused, look at a collection of covers that have been made for this book. It is clear that publishers think the way to get people to read this book is to market it as an up-market romance novel, or a woman's daydream of playing house on the prairie. All the more reason it should have some sex in it! What's the point of playing house if there's no sex?  
% Also the foreword included in this version by Kathleen Norris is pretty bad. Totally the canned foreword that talks about why this book is significant and pulls out a few quotes that are supposed to show how Cather is a master of language... less convincing when every one of those pull quotes is from the first chapter or two of the book. Did Kathleen Norris even actually read the book?

% This is the most _Christian_ book I have ever read. By that I mean, the

% late 19th Century, and all the challenges of living in that time and  
% place in an utterly real (and very modern) manner. And in that setting  
% puts two high-ranking Catholics, who strive (and succeed) at being  
% good Catholics in a world that is hard, diverse, contains true evil

% be truly Christian in a land where many people are non-Christian, and  
% many who are Christian believe in a unique way informed by the previous  
% religions and cultures of their land.  
%   
% Interestingly, I suspect it is read differently by modern readers  
% and contemporary readers in the 1920s and 30s. Now, I'm sure, most  
% modern educated readers who might read this book (like myself) have  
% the perspective of following these studies and understanding it only

%   
% But I don't think Cather meant it to be read like that. I think she

% and for people who have real faith and belief in Christianity. The book  
% is about how to be a _Christian_ in a hard world, not how to be "good."

% That doesn't ruin the critique built into the book exactly. It's just that the critique is more like a punk rock view of suburban life than a particularly feminist one. The critique is still valid, but it's more about the whole misery that is/was suburbia in general than a close explication of the miseries of being a housewife.  
% In the hands of a masterful feminist author, this story could have been told in a way that would have achingly captured the deep horror of suburban housewife life.  
% So it's not that it is a bad book. It's just the regret that it could have been one of the best books ever written about the female experience in suburbia, and it's not that.

% This book is kinda slow. It takes something like 120 pages before there's any actual spying happening. According to Wikipedia, it is a thinly veiled autobiography. MOST of the book is back story filling in the details of what could happen in an aristocratic British person's life to eventually lead him to become a double-agent and betray his country. It feels like le Carre had some personal stuff to work through regarding his father, and he did that in this book. Which makes it sort-of interesting as a character profile of le Carre himself, but kinda boring as a general adventure story. There's little in the way of plot twists or action -- you know, the stuff people actually _want_ in a spy novel. And the richness of the character development doesn't really offset that. It would have been a better book if it had ALL of those things: an exciting adventure AND le Carre's biographical background for character development. It's also left unresolved, really, whether Axel -- the main character's Soviet bloc handler -- was a double-agent himself, or if he was just using Pym. Also (spoiler) having the book end with Pym committing suicide feels like the lazy way to end the book to me. Still, le Carre's a top-notch writer (though I would prefer he went a bit more for clarity rather than style on occasion) and the book is a fairly compelling read -- I never got _bored_ with it.

% Poe was one messed up dude. Most of the first part of the book is just a guy trapped in the dark belowdecks on the ship, starving and forgotten -- ie indistinguishable from being buried alive.

% There is a cool gruesome part where survivors drifting on the hulk of a wrecked ship resort to cannibalism.
% The second part of this book really degrades into garbage. The main character gets on a new ship, and they go, supposedly, past the ice of Antarctica, where they find a warm land nearer the south pole. There they land on an island full of black "savages" (with lots of description of their black skin and loose lips) and the book descends into racist stupidity. Like, really. So bad, it makes me question the value of reading ANY Poe. At one point, a chapter ends with the cliffhanger line, "we were the only white men left on the island." In addition, there's just a lot of totally nonsensical plot points: they tie enough handkerchiefs together to descend a cliff? Use a shirt as a sail? Go towards the south pole to reach a warmer ocean (in the book, the south pole being covered by ocean, not land)?

% I read this whole novel under the mistaken impression that it was a modern novel by some world war II nerd. But it is in fact a 1955 novel by the guy who is most famous for writing the Horatio Hornblower series (he also wrote The African Queen). He also encouraged Roald Dahl to start writing.  
% This is really a terrible novel. It's 200 pages of order (in dialog), order repeated (in dialog), and then an explanation of what that order accomplished. Repeat ad nauseum. The charcter of the captain is interestingly flawed, but I feel like there's not much space to appreciate that in a two day real-time retelling of a story (whatever his flaws, they don't have much impact on the story because they can't play a role in non-stop war action).  
% Even some of the sentence constructions seem to make no sense or they were poorly edited. But more benefit of the doubt has to be given to him if the book was written in 1955. (Maybe the editors just had different standards then, and the minor racist elements can be put aside, I think.)

Sort of an interesting mix between fairly conventional sci fi of the time (surprise! the young man was actually Jesus!) And the more open-ended and mysterious Gene Wolfe that would come in The Book of the New Sun. The best all-around story is The Death of Dr. Island (not the title story, but one of the slightly revised versions of the book title --- and in the copy I have it IS the cover illustration story). It contains a truly unique Gene Wolfe style environment, and all the mysteries that go with that. But it wraps up cleanly with tight resolution and a twist. It would be very satisfying to the person who never could deal with the un-resolvedness of The Book of the New Sun. But I think the stories that are more mysterious, questioning, and magical --- the ones that are more like the Book of the New Sun --- are better. Namely Tracking Song, set in a frozen future of multiple kinds of people/animals with a journey to an underground city that I could swear Wolfe lifted whole-cloth from the bat-people city of Out Of Time's Abyss. The story I probably enjoyed the most (even if not technically as ambitious as The Death of Doctor Island) was Seven American Nights --- both for being set in a future wasteland version of Washington DC in an America that has been afflicted by what is clearly the exact disaster that the Omnibus Podcast dude fear, and also for it's totally Lovecraftian horror twist ending.},

% It turns out that if you remove gender from a society you get... a really boring all-male society. It seems like either ULG -- being a 1970s femenist -- may have wanted to avoid acknowleding the value of "feminine" cultural affects and emphasize the "women are just as tough as men" idea so much that she completely neutralized women right out of the book. The people of her planet are stated to be gender-neutral, but that doesn't really come through in the book. What comes through is an all-male society with some slightly gay sexual interactions that in just a few places in the book manifest themselves as women. She uses the pronoun 'him' for all the characters, and they all sound and act male. Ironically for a book that is supposed to center around gender-neutralness, it's really just a book with no women.
% It is also possible ULG just didn't have the chops to get it there. It would be possible (though probably very difficult) to actually dream a culture up with completely gender-neutral individuals, and have it _feel_ like they are gender neutral. (Perhaps the first step is to just leave aside the mechanics of how they have sex.) But this is really not that book.
% The gender thing acutally doesn't even play that big a role in the book. The world is far more distinguished by being an ice-planet and all the cultural shifts that come with that are far more imposing than any gender issues. That may have been ULG's point, but if so she's just wrong and missed the mark.
% It does have a big chunk of the book dedicated to an arctic sled journey. It feels like ULG might have read The Last Place On Earth and wanted to incorporate that into one of her books. I like a sled journey story, and this maybe the most interesting part of the book. But a far cry from The Last Place On Earth. Or even Call of the Wild.

Now it's been decades since physicists have produced anything more than a blip in a huge database of noise for their hundreds of billions of dollars spent.

% The three books above by E.R. Burroughs form a trilogy that is basically a total rip-off of Doyle's Lost World. These books are overall _terrible_ despite the fact they feature a U-boat. The main characters all have exactly the same voice and though each book is told about a different dude, they all sound exactly the same, and they all have the same relationship to the local women.
% The main distinction from Lost World is a very complicated evolution/tribal system where humans on the lost island evolve through different stages that emigrate to the north end of the island... and then the next generation are laid as eggs that flow down to the south end of the island to hatch as... tadpoles.
% This is the most creative thing about these three books, and the central mystery that gets revealed. It's also incredibly stupid, and hard to fathom why the author thought this would be an interesting piece of sci fi. He might as well have set the thing on another planet, it would at least give a believable undergirding to why the 'humans' are so alien.
% Also, the main antagonists are humanoid demons with giant bat wings that murder each other all the time. Both weird AND stupid.

% It's a neat idea to set up a set of rules for your stories and then work them up.  
% Though it doesn't always work: there's a number of places where you're like "why don't they just _ask_ the robot what the hell it's doing?" or some other super simple solution that Asimov side-steps to make his point in the story.  
% Also many of the characters are extremely weak. I can't even tell the difference between the two main male characters when they are speaking.  
% page 158: A human who lives by the three laws of robotics would make an extremely _good_ human --- perhaps (it's indicated) better than any human actially is. (This is implied about the robot who becomes president of the world.)

% In the early part of this book there's an interesting bit about why Nantucket  
% became such a whaling hub. Initially they just rowed out from the beach and  
% caught whales, but soon there were no more whales and they had to go further  
% and further from the island to catch them. Because of their initial effort to  
% catch whales, the economy grew around whaling. Even though it seems like it  
% must have been an inconvenience to supply the ships from the island instead  
% of the mainland, the whaling started there, and so it continued there.  
%  
% Page 100: The captain is described as not being "fishy" enough (that is  
% bullying) to manage the crew in a survival situation. So he  
% goes with the democractic choice to sail for South America, rather than his

They look like retouched fashion photos, or ads for a high priced workout program.  
% "Maybe this is the reason that these women arouse in Snowman not even the faintest stirrings of lust. It was the thumbprints of human imperfection that used to move him, the flaws in the design: the lopsided smile, the wart next to the navel, the mole, the bruise. These were the places he'd single out, putting his mouth on them. Was it consolation he'd had in mind, kissing the wound to make it better? There was always an element of melancholy involved in sex. After his indiscriminate adolescence he'd preferred sad women, delicate and breakable, women who'd been messed up and who needed him. He'd liked to comfort them, stroke them gently at first, reassure them. Make them happier, if only for a moment. Himself too, of course; that was the payoff. A grateful woman would go the extra mile.

% Why don’t you just eat the plant? Never mind that part – Pay attention. You cook it, and then you cut it into slices, and you put a slice into a toaster, which is a metal box that heats up with electricity – What is electricity? Don’t worry about that. While the slice is in the toaster, you get out the butter – butter is a yellow grease, made from the mammary glands of – skip the butter. So, the toaster turns the slice of bread black on both sides with smoke coming out, and then this “toaster” shoots the slice up into the air, and it falls onto the floor . . .  
% Forget it,” says Snowman. “Let’s try again.” Toast was a pointless invention from the Dark Ages. Toast was an implement of torture that caused all those subjected to it to regurgitate in verbal form the sins and crimes of their past lives. Toast was a ritual item devoured by fetishists in the belief that it would enhance their kinetic and sexual powers.

% Outlines an interesting idea about how a church enduring for hundreds of years whittles out any art that is not both pleasing on the surface for uneducated, and pleasing at a deep level for "sages". Page 154  
% This book makes use of a technique that sometimes comes up in science fiction that for some reason I can't explain is deeply appealing. That is, telling a story at one point in time, where the characters are dealing with objects that are still present, or are discovered much later in the future as part of complete unrelated other people's stories. In this case some documents (which are the central McGuffin of the book) and also a wooden statue, carved in a minor scene in the first part of the book, and reflected on hundreds of years later in the second part of the book.

% There's an interesting bit about how a town is formed - her husband comes to a new town for blacks only, and buys up a big chunk of land and subdivides, as well as starting a store and a post office.  
% The only thing I remembered before re-reading this book was her description of an orgasm as a pear tree.  
% For that reason, I thought this book was about young people.  
% But it's actually about a 40-year old woman. This is one of those books that we stupidly give to teenagers, but they are completely the wrong audience.  
% This book is great - for adults. The language is exceptional. I suspect it's a much better book for 40 year old women to be reading than Eat Pray Love.  
% The other remarkable thing about this book is that it is so _old_. It's from the 1930s, but it's about issues of female self-determination that wouldn't become public topics until the 1960s. It's WAY ahead of it's time, while being about a pretty old-fashioned time period.  
% "All gods dispense suffering without reason. Otherwise they would not be worshipped. Through indiscriminate suffering men know fear and fear is the most divine emotion.

% This is the edition I read an ebook of. There's another edition out there with an Ursala K. Leguin introduction.  
% It's a pretty good read. It does a nice job of keeping you wanting to find out more. But definitely sci-fi of it's time. The whole point is that the technology that aliens left in the zone is so far ahead of our own that scientists can only marvel at it and call it a miracle, not understand it.  
% The part where the zone is described as a "roadside picnic" of aliens is pretty good. Near that section (the same character dialog) are some interesting thoughts about the rationality of man - as in what the hell do we even think it is? And some neat points about how the smartest among us are panicked because they realize how little they know.  
% That same section has some thoughts about the military-industrial complex.  
% The Tarkovsky film was from a screenplay by the same authors, but is best understood as a complete reboot. While this is more or less schlocky 1970s sci-fi, the film is a reboot that throws out the schlock and instead focusses on heavily-lifted concepts of human meaning.  
% The funny thing is that while the book is really from the perspective of some 1960s-70s "everyman" and the movie is from the perspective of high-minded art and philosophy, I would think a real-life stalker going into the zone would be neither of those things, but have elements of both.  
% Oddly, the book is set in Canada.  
% There's some interesting hints about the economics of the city that grows up around the Zone. Reminds me of the city that is built around the crashed ship in Robotech.
