% The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, in a moment of reasoned lucidity which is almost unique among its current tally of five million, nine hundred and seventy-three thousand, five hundred and nine pages, says of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation products that “it is very easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of them by the sense of achievement you get from getting them to work at all.  “In other words—and this is the rock-solid principle on which the whole of the Corporation’s Galaxywide success is founded—their fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws.”

% Note: there is the reading-order problem, see Wikipedia. I read them in publication-order, and it's pretty clear that's best.  
% Some of the books are WAY better than others. The good ones are: LWWD, the  
% Dawn Treder, and The Silver Chair. The Magician's nephew has some cool stuff  
% in it, like the journey to the dead world where they awaken the white queen  
% (with allusions to nuclear haulocaust) but then it descends into a boring  
% recount of the beginning of Narnia (though the origin of the lamppost is  
% cool).  
% The other books range from weak to terrible. Particularly The Horse and His  
% Boy and The Last Battle, which are not only largely dull, but often pretty  
% offensive. (In one case they literally put on brown-face to disguise  
% themselves among the brown people, and there's a number of

% This book is really kinda terrible and boring. The good part is really

% is about sound and noise. Much of it is sorting signal from noise or  
% creating noise to hide a signal. Where the movie relied on visuals to  
% show what was happening (how else could they?) the book is mostly about  
% what people are hearing in the subs. A _brilliant_ submarine book could  
% be written from the sonar operator's perspective, and be entirely about

  category={Novels, whaling, essex, cannibalism, Humanity}  
}  
% In the early part of this book there's an interesting bit about why Nantucket  
% became such a whaling hub. Initially they just rowed out from the beach and  
% caught whales, but soon there were no more whales and they had to go further  
% and further from the island to catch them. Because of their initial effort to  
% catch whales, the economy grew around whaling. Even though it seems like it  
% must have been an inconvenience to supply the ships from the island instead  
% of the mainland, the whaling started there, and so it continued there.  
%  
% Page 100: The captain is described as not being "fishy" enough (that is  
% bullying) to manage the crew in a survival situation. So he  
% goes with the democractic choice to sail for South America, rather than his  
% instinct to sail for the polynesian islands. This seems to me like just  
% chance that his instinct was right. It could easily have been the other way  
% around. This section just seems deeply flawed and subscribes to the myth of  
% the hard-driving leader.  
%  
% Page 115: after a week or so in the boats, the captain's boat is attacked by a  
% second whale (a killer whale) and repairs have to be made.  
%

% Page 186: the first food they ate when rescued was tapioca pudding  
%  
% Page 218: The first four men eaten were all black, but nantucket was an  
% abolitionist stronghold, and the community had a tough time reconciling this.  
%  
% Page 221: the whaling business dies off in Nantucket, quakers losen their  
% rules about not showing off wealth, and the town starts to develop  
% ostentatious displays of wealth, particularly in their housing. Then a big  
% chunk of the town burns down.  
%   
% Page 223: The year from the 19th century with the most whales taken was 1837  
% with 6767 whales. The year from the 20th century with the most whales taken  
% was 1964 with 29,225 whales. (Even though a narrative running through the  
% whole book is the Nantucketers going further and further  
% around the world looking for whales because they keep killing  
% of more local populations, you get the feeling the author  
% includes this statistic as the justification for romancing  
% the 19th century whaling industry - because HE is clearly  
% romanced with it. I'm skeptical of his 20th century whales  
% killed stat. WHAT whales? Maybe it includes 20k pilot whales,  
% or even more likely, minkes - small whales that there are  
% huge numbers of in the ocean. Not to defend 20th century  
% whaling, just that I really believe 19th century whaling  
% can't be defended.)   
% page 224 - the ships pusie hall, the lydia, two generals, and pocahantas are  
% attacked by whales in later decades.  
%  
% 224-227 the story of the ann alexander, sunk by a whale in much the same manner  
% as moby dick in the year of its publication, in the same waters as the essex.  
% With whaleboats crushed they chase the whale down, while the captain stands in  
% the bow of the ship with a lance. The whale sinks the ship. Later the whale is  
% killed, weapons are found in its side and head. Melville hears of this and

% “Every time the women appear, Snowman is astonished all over again. They're every known colour from the deepest black to whitest white, they're various heights, but each one of them is admirably proportioned. Each is sound of tooth, smooth of skin. No ripples of fat around their waists, no bulges, no dimpled orange-skin cellulite on their thighs. No body hair, no bushiness. They look like retouched fashion photos, or ads for a high priced workout program.  
% "Maybe this is the reason that these women arouse in Snowman not even the faintest stirrings of lust. It was the thumbprints of human imperfection that used to move him, the flaws in the design: the lopsided smile, the wart next to the navel, the mole, the bruise. These were the places he'd single out, putting his mouth on them. Was it consolation he'd had in mind, kissing the wound to make it better? There was always an element of melancholy involved in sex. After his indiscriminate adolescence he'd preferred sad women, delicate and breakable, women who'd been messed up and who needed him. He'd liked to comfort them, stroke them gently at first, reassure them. Make them happier, if only for a moment. Himself too, of course; that was the payoff. A grateful woman would go the extra mile.   
% "But these new women are neither lopsided nor sad: they're placid, like animated statues. They leave him chilled.” Page 100  
% “What is toast?” says Snowman to himself, once they’ve run off. Toast is when you take a piece of bread – What is bread? Bread is when you take some flour – What is flour?  
% We’ll skip that part, it’s too complicated. Bread is something you can eat, made from a ground-up plant and shaped like a stone. You cook it . . . Please, why do you cook it?  
% Why don’t you just eat the plant? Never mind that part – Pay attention. You cook it, and then you cut it into slices, and you put a slice into a toaster, which is a metal box that heats up with electricity – What is electricity? Don’t worry about that. While the slice is in the toaster, you get out the butter – butter is a yellow grease, made from the mammary glands of – skip the butter. So, the toaster turns the slice of bread black on both sides with smoke coming out, and then this “toaster” shoots the slice up into the air, and it falls onto the floor . . .  
% Forget it,” says Snowman. “Let’s try again.” Toast was a pointless invention from the Dark Ages. Toast was an implement of torture that caused all those subjected to it to regurgitate in verbal form the sins and crimes of their past lives. Toast was a ritual item devoured by fetishists in the belief that it would enhance their kinetic and sexual powers.

  category={Novels}  
}  
% There's an interesting bit about how a town is formed - her husband comes to a new town for blacks only, and buys up a big chunk of land and subdivides, as well as starting a store and a post office.  
% The only thing I remembered before re-reading this book was her description of an orgasm as a pear tree.  
% For that reason, I thought this book was about young people.  
% But it's actually about a 40-year old woman. This is one of those books that we stupidly give to teenagers, but they are completely the wrong audience.  
% This book is great - for adults. The language is exceptional. I suspect it's a much better book for 40 year old women to be reading than Eat Pray Love.  
% The other remarkable thing about this book is that it is so _old_. It's from the 1930s, but it's about issues of female self-determination that wouldn't become public topics until the 1960s. It's WAY ahead of it's time, while being about a pretty old-fashioned time period.  
% "All gods dispense suffering without reason. Otherwise they would not be worshipped. Through indiscriminate suffering men know fear and fear is the most divine emotion. It is the stones for altars and the beginning of wisdom. Half gods are worshipped in wine and flowers. Real gods require blood." - Page 216

% This is the edition I read an ebook of. There's another edition out there with an Ursala K. Leguin introduction.  
% It's a pretty good read. It does a nice job of keeping you wanting to find out more. But definitely sci-fi of it's time. The whole point is that the technology that aliens left in the zone is so far ahead of our own that scientists can only marvel at it and call it a miracle, not understand it.  
% The part where the zone is described as a "roadside picnic" of aliens is pretty good. Near that section (the same character dialog) are some interesting thoughts about the rationality of man - as in what the hell do we even think it is? And some neat points about how the smartest among us are panicked because they realize how little they know.  
% That same section has some thoughts about the military-industrial complex.  
% The Tarkovsky film was from a screenplay by the same authors, but is best understood as a complete reboot. While this is more or less schlocky 1970s sci-fi, the film is a reboot that throws out the schlock and instead focusses on heavily-lifted concepts of human meaning.  
% The funny thing is that while the book is really from the perspective of some 1960s-70s "everyman" and the movie is from the perspective of high-minded art and philosophy, I would think a real-life stalker going into the zone would be neither of those things, but have elements of both.  
% Oddly, the book is set in Canada.  
% There's some interesting hints about the economics of the city that grows up around the Zone. Reminds me of the city that is built around the crashed ship in Robotech.

% It's impossible to read this book after having read Lost Girls without reading a whole second story between the lines about maturing sexually.

For me it is also hard to read this book without hearing the broadway musical in the lines.
