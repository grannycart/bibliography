  comment={A high-level British spy, Magnus Pym, is discovered to be a double-agent for the Soviet bloc. This books tells the story of his life that led to his development as a double-agent. The key linchpin being that his father was a high-level con man. The main character realizes by the end of the novel that being a double-agent requires him to lead the same kinds of multiple-lives as his con man father.},

% This book is kinda slow. It takes something like 120 pages before there's any actual spying happening. According to Wikipedia, it is a thinly veiled autobiography. MOST of the book is back story filling in the details of what could happen in an aristocratic British person's life to eventually lead him to become a double-agent and betray his country. It feels like le Carre had some personal stuff to work through regarding his father, and he did that in this book. Which makes it sort-of interesting as a character profile of le Carre himself, but kinda boring as a general adventure story. There's little in the way of plot twists or action -- you know, the stuff people actually _want_ in a spy novel. And the richness of the character development doesn't really offset that. It would have been a better book if it had ALL of those things: an exciting adventure AND le Carre's biographical background for character development. It's also left unresolved, really, whether Axel -- the main character's Soviet bloc handler -- was a double-agent himself, or if he was just using Pym. Also (spoiler) having the book end with Pym committing suicide feels like the lazy way to end the book to me. Still, le Carre's a top-notch writer (though I would prefer he went a bit more for clarity rather than style on occasion) and the book is a fairly compelling read -- I never got _bored_ with it.

There is very little one can point to when describing why it is good. Yet it is utterly compelling. The only thing I could think of that it reminds me of is the vignettes Roald Dahl would use to set up his character in his childern's novels. But those are about bizarre events and people. This is about totally conventional Americans. Somehow, it works and it is a joy to read.},

% Poe was one messed up dude. Most of the first part of the book is just a guy trapped in the dark belowdecks on the ship, starving and forgotten -- ie indistinguishable from being buried alive. At one point, he describes waking up with the sensation of a demon on his chest -- one of the classic signals of sleep paralysis -- but it turns out to be his giant newfoundland dog sitting on him.    
% There is an interesting bit where Poe talks about stowage on ships, and how grain is incredibly dangerous is stowed improperly because it could roll a boat over (like a slack tank on Deadliest Catch).  
% There is a cool gruesome part where survivors drifting on the hulk of a wrecked ship resort to cannibalism.
% The second part of this book really degrades into garbage. The main character gets on a new ship, and they go, supposedly, past the ice of Antarctica, where they find a warm land nearer the south pole. There they land on an island full of black "savages" (with lots of description of their black skin and loose lips) and the book descends into racist stupidity. Like, really. So bad, it makes me question the value of reading ANY Poe. At one point, a chapter ends with the cliffhanger line, "we were the only white men left on the island." In addition, there's just a lot of totally nonsensical plot points: they tie enough handkerchiefs together to descend a cliff? Use a shirt as a sail? Go towards the south pole to reach a warmer ocean (in the book, the south pole being covered by ocean, not land)? (Even in the book, he acknowledges this goes counter to the current understanding of the south pole -- I guess this was written at a time when the general public knew so little about Antarctica, that it was possible *anything* might be there.)

The narrator reveals that the parts of Don Quixote written by Pierre Menard (though exactly the same as the version written by Cervantes) have a different meaning than the original. \emph{The Babylon Lottery} describes a game of chance, carried out by the Company, that grows ever more popular until all events and circumstance are determined by the lottery (pre-dating of course the possibility that dungeons and dragons/tabletop gaming represent precisely this scenario). \emph{The Library of Babel} is about an (infinite?) library made up of books containing every possible permutation of the alphabet.},

% Page 25: includes a glyph for an upside down '5', but they printed the wrong glyph.  
% Page 42: The term 'front' is a military term that may be a phonological accident. The meteorology was developed in the years following the first world war. Stewart suggests that if it had been developed during peaceful times, it may have been a term derived from marriage instead of war --- which is just as apt a metaphor for the weather as war is.  
% Page 82: The white farmers built levees to keep the river off their land, but when all the white men did this, the river just rose and eventually topped the levees again. This was only fixed (says Stewart) when the engineers looked at the river as a whole, and figure out it needed to be able to flood in places.

% Page 266: "16 dead by storm!" says the paper. But Stewart says the storm was just the occasion of their death, and the cause was their own mortality. Stewart says if the papers are going to hold the storm responsible for 16 deaths, "why not hundreds? Many invalids died during the days of the storm, their deaths precipitated by chills and heart-depression, attributable to the weather. Some healthy persons suffered wet feet which led to colds, pneumonia, and death within a few weeks. Other colds resulted in weakened resistance which opened the way for various fatal diseases.

% Page 31-33: description of bombed out dock area, with lots of detail of the grime and the scene of industrial decay. Reminds me of when they go through the military depot in Stalker.  
% Page 72: reference to coffee as "nigger sweat". These two words are probably the reason you almost never hear anyone talking about reading this book any more (there is also a second use of the n-word later in the book). Which, fair enough. And as much as I'm against censorship and preserving the historical record, evil and all, why not just remove this line from the book? On the other hand, these guys ARE (technically) Nazis, even if reluctantly so. Maybe it's interesting to leave it in since just because the German Navy was (supposedly) not very enamored of Hitler, that doesn't mean they aren't just good ol' mid-century racists.  
% Page 125: "Actually we ought to be able to get along with a lot fewer men. I keep imagining a boat that would only need a crew of two or three. Exactly like an airplane. Basically we have all these men on board because the designers failed to do a proper job."  
% Page 203: They push the boat beyond 700 feet (the boat is rated to 300 feet) while being depth charged. All the power goes out and the depth gauges explode. So they are feeling around on the floor in the dark for the needle that blew off the depth gauge because without it not only do they not know how deep they are, but they also don't know if the boat is rising or sinking. "It feels as if all our lives depend on whether this this strip of metal will move or not."

% I read this whole novel under the mistaken impression that it was a modern novel by some world war II nerd. But it is in fact a 1955 novel by the guy who is most famous for writing the Horatio Hornblower series (he also wrote The African Queen). He also encouraged Roald Dahl to start writing.  
% This is really a terrible novel. It's 200 pages of order (in dialog), order repeated (in dialog), and then an explanation of what that order accomplished. Repeat ad nauseum. The charcter of the captain is interestingly flawed, but I feel like there's not much space to appreciate that in a two day real-time retelling of a story (whatever his flaws, they don't have much impact on the story because they can't play a role in non-stop war action).  
% Even some of the sentence constructions seem to make no sense or they were poorly edited. But more benefit of the doubt has to be given to him if the book was written in 1955. (Maybe the editors just had different standards then, and the minor racist elements can be put aside, I think.)

Those who listened unwarily to that voice could seldom report the words that they heard; and if they did, they wondered, for little power remained in them. Mostly they remembered only that it was a delight to hear the voice speaking, all that it said seemed wise and reasonable, and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wide themselves.

A creature of an older world maybe it was, whose kind, lingering in forgotten mountains cold beneath the Moon, outstayed their day, and in hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brood, apt to evil. And the Dark Lord took it, and nursed it with fell meats, until it grew beyond the measure of all other things that fly; and he gave it to his servant to be his steed. Down, down it came, and then, folding its fingered webs, it gave a croaking cry, and settled upon the body of Snowmane, digging in its claws, stooping its long naked neck. [the best paragraph in the book -- I suspect this is where Cormac McCarthy stole his style from. Also read through to the slaying of the Nazgul by Eowyn.]

% Chesterton's attempt to get in on the Sherlock Holmes deductive detective fad. Chesterton's detective is kinda a cool character -- 'the man who knew too much.' But these stories are mostly reallllly boring. He usually sets up like half a dozen characters that all seem the same and then you have to track who killed who and why while it is all wrapped up in oblique and out-dated references to hundred-year-old British politics. There's a reason this one isn't a classic.

% It would be cool to turn this book into a stageplay. It wouldn't be too hard, considering it's almost all dialog, you would just have to make some decisions in places about who is speaking. (Some Gaddis scholar could probably clear things up pretty easily.) Then giving actors all the lines, with a few off-stage actions like the car crash, would bring the book to life in a way that people who don't have the patience to sit reading 800 pages of dialog might be willing to put up with. Though it would be, of course, like 20 hours long...

He likes to think I am being entertained; and I am, I am.   
% The above line is maybe the best example, but the theme of BDSM-like power-exchange runs through the book. I am not sure how this isn't the _most_ talked about aspect of the book.

  comment={A collection of short stories in the traditional style ("And then, big twist in the last sentence!") Sort of an interesting mix between fairly conventional sci fi of the time (surprise! the young man was actually Jesus!) And the more open-ended and mysterious Gene Wolfe that would come in The Book of the New Sun. The best all-around story is The Death of Dr. Island (not the title story, but one of the slightly revised versions of the book title --- and in the copy I have it IS the cover illustration story). It contains a truly unique Gene Wolfe style environment, and all the mysteries that go with that. But it wraps up cleanly with tight resolution and a twist. It would be very satisfying to the person who never could deal with the un-resolvedness of The Book of the New Sun. But I think the stories that are more mysterious, questioning, and magical --- the ones that are more like the Book of the New Sun --- are better. Namely Tracking Song, set in a frozen future of multiple kinds of people/animals with a journey to an underground city that I could swear Wolfe lifted whole-cloth from the bat-people city of Out Of Time's Abyss. The story I probably enjoyed the most (even if not technically as ambitious as The Death of Doctor Island) was Seven American Nights --- both for being set in a future wasteland version of Washington DC in an America that has been afflicted by what is clearly the exact disaster that the Omnibus Podcast dude fear, and also for it's totally Lovecraftian horror twist ending.},

% It turns out that if you remove gender from a society you get... a really boring all-male society. It seems like either ULG -- being a 1970s femenist -- may have wanted to avoid acknowleding the value of "feminine" cultural affects and emphasize the "women are just as tough as men" idea so much that she completely neutralized women right out of the book. The people of her planet are stated to be gender-neutral, but that doesn't really come through in the book. What comes through is an all-male society with some slightly gay sexual interactions that in just a few places in the book manifest themselves as women. She uses the pronoun 'him' for all the characters, and they all sound and act male. Ironically for a book that is supposed to center around gender-neutralness, it's really just a book with no women.
% It is also possible ULG just didn't have the chops to get it there. It would be possible (though probably very difficult) to actually dream a culture up with completely gender-neutral individuals, and have it _feel_ like they are gender neutral. (Perhaps the first step is to just leave aside the mechanics of how they have sex.) But this is really not that book.
% The gender thing acutally doesn't even play that big a role in the book. The world is far more distinguished by being an ice-planet and all the cultural shifts that come with that are far more imposing than any gender issues. That may have been ULG's point, but if so she's just wrong and missed the mark.
% It does have a big chunk of the book dedicated to an arctic sled journey. It feels like ULG might have read The Last Place On Earth and wanted to incorporate that into one of her books. I like a sled journey story, and this maybe the most interesting part of the book. But a far cry from The Last Place On Earth. Or even Call of the Wild.

% Really, just not a super fun book. The anarchists live on the moon. They have issues. The capitalists live on the planet. They have issues too. Everyone has issues. Whoop de do.
% It is interesting to note that being written in what was effectively still the mid-20th-Century, the character with the secret door-opening knowledge so coveted by all worlds is a physicist. But that's because physicists were the ones who gave the US nuclear bombs (in real life) not so long before. Those people were still the coveted elite in the 1970s on Earth. Now it's been decades since physicists have produced anything more than a blip in a huge database of noise for their hundreds of billions of dollars spent. If this book were written today, the coveted secret-knoweldge person would probably be a computer programmer.

% Arthur Conan Doyle's adventure story where the protaganists journey deep into the Amazon and make their way up to the top of a tepui to find a place where dinosaurs and ice-age beasts still roam... along with some questionable paleolithic peoples.
% It seems, from reading this and the land that time forgot series, that maybe the idea of a land where dinosaurs roam seems cool at first, but then when one goes to write a book about it the author realizes there's not very much you can do with the idea to keep it interesting. In all the books they end up bringing in native human populations to create some kind of more human element for the characters to contend with, and in both series it feels like the human-to-human interactions totally take over from the characters interacting with the prehistoric monsters.

% The three books above by E.R. Burroughs form a trilogy that is basically a total rip-off of Doyle's Lost World. These books are overall _terrible_ despite the fact they feature a U-boat. The main characters all have exactly the same voice and though each book is told about a different dude, they all sound exactly the same, and they all have the same relationship to the local women.
% The main distinction from Lost World is a very complicated evolution/tribal system where humans on the lost island evolve through different stages that emigrate to the north end of the island... and then the next generation are laid as eggs that flow down to the south end of the island to hatch as... tadpoles.
% This is the most creative thing about these three books, and the central mystery that gets revealed. It's also incredibly stupid, and hard to fathom why the author thought this would be an interesting piece of sci fi. He might as well have set the thing on another planet, it would at least give a believable undergirding to why the 'humans' are so alien.
% Also, the main antagonists are humanoid demons with giant bat wings that murder each other all the time. Both weird AND stupid.

% ‚ÄúEvery time the women appear, Snowman is astonished all over again. They're every known colour from the deepest black to whitest white, they're various heights, but each one of them is admirably proportioned. Each is sound of tooth, smooth of skin. No ripples of fat around their waists, no bulges, no dimpled orange-skin cellulite on their thighs. No body hair, no bushiness. They look like retouched fashion photos, or ads for a high priced workout program.  
% "Maybe this is the reason that these women arouse in Snowman not even the faintest stirrings of lust. It was the thumbprints of human imperfection that used to move him, the flaws in the design: the lopsided smile, the wart next to the navel, the mole, the bruise. These were the places he'd single out, putting his mouth on them. Was it consolation he'd had in mind, kissing the wound to make it better? There was always an element of melancholy involved in sex. After his indiscriminate adolescence he'd preferred sad women, delicate and breakable, women who'd been messed up and who needed him. He'd liked to comfort them, stroke them gently at first, reassure them. Make them happier, if only for a moment. Himself too, of course; that was the payoff. A grateful woman would go the extra mile.

While the slice is in the toaster, you get out the butter ‚Äì butter is a yellow grease, made from the mammary glands of ‚Äì skip the butter. So, the toaster turns the slice of bread black on both sides with smoke coming out, and then this ‚Äútoaster‚Äù shoots the slice up into the air, and it falls onto the floor . . .  
% Forget it,‚Äù says Snowman. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try again.‚Äù Toast was a pointless invention from the Dark Ages. Toast was an implement of torture that caused all those subjected to it to regurgitate in verbal form the sins and crimes of their past lives. Toast was a ritual item devoured by fetishists in the belief that it would enhance their kinetic and sexual powers.

% But it's actually about a 40-year old woman. This is one of those books that we stupidly give to teenagers, but they are completely the wrong audience.  
% This book is great - for adults. The language is exceptional. I suspect it's a much better book for 40 year old women to be reading than Eat Pray Love.  
% The other remarkable thing about this book is that it is so _old_. It's from the 1930s, but it's about issues of female self-determination that wouldn't become public topics until the 1960s. It's WAY ahead of it's time, while being about a pretty old-fashioned time period.

% The part where the zone is described as a "roadside picnic" of aliens is pretty good. Near that section (the same character dialog) are some interesting thoughts about the rationality of man - as in what the hell do we even think it is? And some neat points about how the smartest among us are panicked because they realize how little they know.  
% That same section has some thoughts about the military-industrial complex.  
% The Tarkovsky film was from a screenplay by the same authors, but is best understood as a complete reboot. While this is more or less schlocky 1970s sci-fi, the film is a reboot that throws out the schlock and instead focusses on heavily-lifted concepts of human meaning.  
% The funny thing is that while the book is really from the perspective of some 1960s-70s "everyman" and the movie is from the perspective of high-minded art and philosophy, I would think a real-life stalker going into the zone would be neither of those things, but have elements of both.  
% Oddly, the book is set in Canada.  
% There's some interesting hints about the economics of the city that grows up around the Zone. Reminds me of the city that is built around the crashed ship in Robotech.
