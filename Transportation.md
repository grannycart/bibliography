We provide new evidence on helmet laws by studying Canada using difference-in-differences models and restricted area-identified public health survey data with information on cycling and helmet use for nearly 800,000 individuals from 1994-2014.  We first confirm prior patterns from the US that laws requiring youths to wear helmets significantly increased youth helmet use.  We then provide the literature’s first comprehensive evidence that ‘all-age’ bicycle helmet laws significantly increased both adult and youth helmet use by 50 to 190 percent relative to pre-reform levels, with larger effects for younger adults, and less-educated adults.  All-age helmet laws had modest effects at reducing cycling and increasing in-home exercise during winter months among adults but did not meaningfully affect weight.  Finally, we find larger effects of helmet laws at increasing helmet use for adults with children in the household, consistent with role-modeling behavior.  Overall our findings confirm that all-age helmet laws can be effective at increasing population helmet use without significant unintended adverse health consequences.},

	abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to calculate exposure-based bicycling hospitalisation rates in Canadian jurisdictions with different helmet legislation and bicycling mode shares, and to examine whether the rates were related to these differences.Methods Administrative data on hospital stays for bicycling injuries to 10 body region groups and national survey data on bicycling trips were used to calculate hospitalisation rates. Rates were calculated for 44 sex, age and jurisdiction strata for all injury causes and 22 age and jurisdiction strata for traffic-related injury causes. Inferential analyses examined associations between hospitalisation rates and sex, age group, helmet legislation and bicycling mode share.Results In Canada, over the study period 2006{\textendash}2011, there was an average of 3690 hospitalisations per year and an estimated 593 million annual trips by bicycle among people 12 years of age and older, for a cycling hospitalisation rate of 622 per 100 million trips (95\% CI 611 to 633). Hospitalisation rates varied substantially across the jurisdiction, age and sex strata, but only two characteristics explained this variability. For all injury causes, sex was associated with hospitalisation rates; females had rates consistently lower than males. For traffic-related injury causes, higher cycling mode share was consistently associated with lower hospitalisation rates. Helmet legislation was not associated with hospitalisation rates for brain, head, scalp, skull, face or neck injuries.Conclusions These results suggest that transportation and health policymakers who aim to reduce bicycling injury rates in the population should focus on factors related to increased cycling mode share and female cycling choices. Bicycling routes designed to be physically separated from traffic or along quiet streets fit both these criteria and are associated with lower relative risks of injury.},

We revisit this idea. There is no question that road systems experience periods in which capacity falls. However, we point out that capacity is determined by both demand and supply. Road construction, lane closures, stalled vehicles, weather, and other supply shocks provide an alternative explanation for the empirical evidence on hypercongestion. Using data from the Caldecott Tunnel in Oakland, California, we show that a naive regression recovers the standard hypercongestion result in the literature. However, once we use instrumental variables to isolate the effect of travel demand this effect disappears and across specifications we find no evidence that capacity decreases during periods of high demand. This lack of evidence of hypercongestion calls into question long-standing conventional wisdom held by transportation engineers and implies that efficient “Pigouvian” congestion taxes should be substantially lower than implied by hypercongestion models.},

The best solution is a combination of curved snow plow blades that are more effective at clearing roads, and simply using less salt. We've drastically increased the amount of salt used since th 1970s.},

  abstract={In this study of how off-street parking requirements affect urban form, we begin by analyzing the relationship between population density and streets in cities. We find that denser cities devote a greater share of their land to streets, but also have less street space per person. This relationship results in part from the difficulty of constructing new streets in built-out areas. The amount of street space does not increase as fast as population density, and this in turn helps explain why dense areas have less vehicle travel per person but higher levels of congestion. In contrast to streets, new off-street parking is supplied continually, owing largely to minimum parking requirements that make new development contingent on the provision of parking spaces. But the ample supply of off-street parking makes traffic congestion worse and inhibits street life. We recommend either removing off-street parking requirements, or converting them from minimums to maximums.},

  comment={Like many other areas of transportation and behavorial economics, here is yet another counter-intuitive finding that suffers from the tragedy of the commons. Researches find that standing two abreast on escalators would move everyone faster through the escalator "system" than people standing right and walking left. This is because while an individual walking will get up the escalator faster, they take up more space on the escalator than standers, and so everyone has to wait longer to get on the escalator because it is handling less capacity.},

In short, to undermine organized labor.''},  
  category={Transportation, trains, rail service, unions, great britain, london, labor}

% The details actually sugest that privitization isn't as much the problem as the public-private partnership:  
% "The privatizers claimed that competition would lift standards of service, put the needs of the consumer first, reduce the burden on the taxpayer, rid the system of inefficiencies and drive down prices. On all scores, the privatization of Britain’s railways is an embarrassment. Look no further than the current dispute on Southern to see how dysfunctional the privatized system is.  Govia is contracted to run the Southern franchise — and is paid about £1 billion (or $1.24 billion), a year by the government to do so. In return, revenue from ticket sales goes directly back to the government. Yet if train services are delayed or canceled, it is the government — or rather, the taxpayer — that refunds the bitter commuters. The company itself therefore has no incentive to settle with the unions; arguably, it is being paid by the Tory government to keep up the fight. Yet the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, pretends to have no hand in the matter, saying he cannot “wave a wand” to resolve the dispute."  
% This whole fiasco serves as a general warning against privitization, sure.  
% But it also shows that public-private partnership setups can be very complicated to make them work correctly. Basic economic motives can undermine the goals of such partnerships if they aren't built right.

  abstract={We  investigate  the  relationship  between  the  extent  of  a  city’s  subway  network,  its  
population  and  its  spatial  configuration.   To  accomplish  this  investigation,  for  the 632 largest cities  in  the  world  we  construct  panel  data  describing  population,  measures  of  centralization calculated from lights at night data,  and the extent of each of the 138 subway systems in these cities.   These  data  indicate  that  large  cities  are  more  likely  to  have  subways  but  that  subways have an economically insignificant effect on urban population growth. Our data also indicate that subways cause cities to decentralize, although the effect is smaller than previously documented effects  of  highways  on  decentralization.   For  a  subset  of  subway  cities  we  observe  panel  data describing  subway  and  bus  ridership.   For  those  cities  we  find  that  a 10 \%  increase  in  subway extent causes about a 6 \% increase in subway ridership and has no effect on bus ridership.},  
  comment={Interesting research showing that subways actually DECREASE centralization of cities (though not nearly as much as highways do) and bigger subways are not correlated with bigger cities.

abstract = { ABSTRACTIdentifying and measuring the land value uplift (LVU) impacts of rapid transit are important for a number of reasons. However, despite the general notion that rapid transit does confer positive LVU benefits, our comprehensive and critical review of more than 130 analyses across 60 studies completed in North America over the past 40 years finds significant heterogeneity in research outcomes, leaving many significant questions unanswered. Beyond high-level differences in study inputs, we argue that a fundamental source of variability is a lack of empirical specificity from the use of proximity as the dominant way in which LVU benefits are captured. This use of a proxy leads to the potential for omitted variables and unobserved relationships, and exposes previous work to the potential for misvalued results. To overcome this issue, we outline recommendations for future research, namely a recognition of relative accessibility and the possibility of LVU impacts from transit-oriented development. Incorporating measures related to these factors into LVU models can reveal their implicit prices, resulting in research that is more theoretically inclusive, empirically comprehensive, comparable, and able to provide important information to inform policy analysis and prescription. },  
comment = {Transit is often funded by borrowing against the future increased value of property taxes near new transit. This paper suggests that is a flawed approach because land values actually only go up in certain neighborhoods. (Like far-flung traffic-congested neighborhoods.) Also, it appears that much of increased land value is actually from neighborhood ``improvements'' in general (read: gentrification) of which transit access may only play a tiny part.},

% As usual, I can't actually access this paper. Read about it here: \url{http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/04/transit-station-property-value-study/479730/}  
% It sounds like the paper discusses the physical/plannery improvements of a neighborhood (like "Transit Oriented Development") and how those physical improvements might drive up land value despite transit improvements, not because of them.  
% But it reveals the fundamental flaw in the economin analysis part of the planning field: planning always assumes a neighborhood is the same people, or that the people who live in a neighborhood don't matter as much as the economic measures. So a city is more interested in increasing property values than anything else, in order to have a higher tax base. But that ignores the fact that a higher tax base is almost certainly a reflection of _different_ people living in a neighborhood.

In this paper,  we de- scribe ‘Streetscore’, a scene understanding algorithm that predicts the perceived safety of a streetscape, using training data  from  an  online  survey  with  contributions  from  more than 7000 participants.  We first study the predictive power of commonly used image features using support vector regression,  finding  that  Geometric  Texton  and  Color  Histograms along with GIST are the best performers when it comes to predict the perceived safety of a streetscape.  Using Streetscore, we create high resolution maps of perceived safety  for  21  cities  in  the  Northeast  and  Midwest  of  the United  States  at  a  resolution  of  200  images/square  mile, scoring 1 million images from Google Streetview.

Uconnect, an Internet-connected computer feature in hundreds of thousands of Fiat Chrysler cars, SUVs, and trucks, controls the vehicle’s entertainment and navigation, enables phone calls, and even offers a Wi-Fi hot spot.'' ``From that entry point, Miller and Valasek’s attack pivots to an adjacent chip in the car’s head unit—the hardware for its entertainment system—silently rewriting the chip’s firmware to plant their code. That rewritten firmware is capable of sending commands through the car’s internal computer network, known as a CAN bus, to its physical components like the engine and wheels. Miller and Valasek say the attack on the entertainment system seems to work on any Chrysler vehicle with Uconnect from late 2013, all of 2014, and early 2015.''

  abstract = {The wide adoption of self-driving, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) promises to dramatically reduce the number of traffic accidents. Some accidents, though, will be inevitable, because some situations will require AVs to choose the lesser of two evils. For example, running over a pedestrian on the road or a passer-by on the side; or choosing whether to run over a group of pedestrians or to sacrifice the passenger by driving into a wall. It is a formidable challenge to define the algorithms that will guide AVs confronted with such moral dilemmas. In particular, these moral algorithms will need to accomplish three potentially incompatible objectives: being consistent, not causing public outrage, and not discouraging buyers. We argue to achieve these objectives, manufacturers and regulators will need psychologists to apply the methods of experimental ethics to situations involving AVs and unavoidable harm. To illustrate our claim, we report three surveys showing that laypersons are relatively comfortable with utilitarian AVs, programmed to minimize the death toll in case of unavoidable harm. We give special attention to whether an AV should save lives by sacrificing its owner, and provide insights into (i) the perceived morality of this self-sacrifice, (ii) the willingness to see this self-sacrifice being legally enforced, (iii) the expectations that AVs will be programmed to self-sacrifice, and (iv) the willingness to buy self-sacrificing AVs. },

And this coverage at MIT: \url{http://www.technologyreview.com/view/542626/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/} which points out that because self-driving cars are so much safer in general, you create a moral dillemma if you choose not to purchase one that would sacrifice you, because your dangerous driving puts more people at risk.},

% Also is it really fair for a car to choose to kill a smaller group of pedestrians? Say it chooses a lone pedestrian over a group of them, over 4 people in it's own car? Seems like that lone pedestrian got the shaft since they didn't make any choice at all, the robot did.

  journal={The Atlantic},  
  date={2015-11-13},  
  comment = {The reason NYC subways mostly lack countdown clocks are complex and deep. There's three major competing systems half-implemented on different parts of the subway system. One of which aims to replace most of the old mechanical control system with software - ``The bulk of the system’s complexity is moved into software: software that interfaces with the physical train controls; software that understands the entire system’s track layout, including all switches, grades, and stations; and software with a huge number of rules about what kind of movements are allowed when.'' This article includes a nice basic introduction to how train control works. See also this graphic from Time Out about the length and ridership on subways worldwide: \url{http://www.timeout.com/newyork/travel/infograph-the-nyc-subway-versus-subways-around-the-world} ``Having full-time software experts running the show turned out to be crucial. Previous incarnations of the project didn’t have a technical leader at the MTA—just old-school senior managers who would try to wrangle the contractors by force of will. The new in-house team, by contrast, was qualified to define exactly what they wanted from software providers in terms those providers could understand. They were qualified to evaluate progress. They could sniff out problems early.''  ``I keep thinking of Healthcare.gov. Everyone knows that the initial project was a costly disaster, but less well known is that a small team came along and saved it. The story includes this remarkable fact: The old system cost 250 million to build and 70 million a year to maintain. The new system—which actually worked—cost about 4 million to build; its yearly maintenance was about 1 million.''},
