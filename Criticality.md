  comment={Since the 1980s more women than men apply for college, and they have higher merit than men. But colleges gender-balance admissions to make sure they have roughly equal numbers of men on campus. That means that the better women perform overall, the less likely they will be able to get into college. This is legal because there is an exemption in Title IX for the admissions process that entirely allows universities to prop up the male half of their classes with no other justification than that it is what women want too. The S.F.F.A Supreme Court case that overturned affirmative action lays out a clear argument for overturning gender-balancing for univeristy admissions too. But, since liberal groups are unlikely to file a case that backs up the overturning of affirmative action, and conservative groups are unlikely to file a case that would result in weakening the position of white men at universities, it is unclear where this case could come from.},

"The trick to achieving these payoffs is to balance on the knife edge between excessive skepticism of unorthodoxy and excessive credulity. It's all too easy to fall off that knife's edge in either direction." Contrarianism is a "brain rotting drug" that causes you to lose the ability to tell good evidence from bad and cling to low-quality contrarian fads and lose the ability to judge other contrarians. Tech bros are especially susceptible because they often got rich by embracing some outsider perspective on something, and thus (falsely) gain the confidence to consider themselves uniquely brilliant and able to master any subject without consulting the people who have actually worked hard to understand an issue. Great wealth also leads them to being surrounded with yes-men. "It may seem odd to see men of vast wealth and influence buying into conspiracy theories about elites running the world. Aren’t they the elites? But I suspect that famous, wealthy men may be especially frustrated by their inability to control events, or even stop people from ridiculing them on the internet. So rather than accepting that the world is a complicated place nobody can control, they’re susceptible to the idea that there are secret cabals out to get them." Ala Henry Ford.},

It took decades longer than expected and cost 42 billion dollars (against an initial estimate of 1.4 billion dollars and completed in a few years). The stockpile was built up, like nuclear weapons, as a supposed deterrent against attacks with chemical weapons. The public was not informed as the scale of the stockpile (which makes one seriously question the value as a deterrent...) The public only found out about the stockpile in 1968 when 5600 sheep in Utah died on land adjacent to a site where the Army was testing chemical weapons. The Army was doing open-air testing at a number of locations and storing chemicals in 8 states. Decades and decades later, 2900 percent over budget, the weapons were all safely disposed of.},

  comment={Warren Buffet continues to adhere to the precept that Berkshire Hathaway should be first and foremost responsible to its investors. This is in contrast to what is becoming the standard practice of creating reports for how a corporation is responding to climate change, diversity, and other socially valuable priorities. Despite this, Berkshire Hathaway still meets many diversity, climate, and other goals simply because those seem to be good business for Berkshire subsidiaries, (though maybe at a slower pace of change than more aggressive policy-oriented corporations). Buffet refuses to change as the world changes around him. For his individual case, it's not clear that's a bad thing.},  
  category={Criticality, berkshire hathaway, invesing, social investing}  
}  
% An interesting piece because what is being described here is that Buffet is the epitome of the benevolent dictatorship. Buffet is able to achieve reasonable results for progressive goals simply by being his uncompromising self focused on the greatest good for everyone in his corporation with guide post of investor returns -- particularly to individuals who invested in buying Berkshire stock with their own money rather than institutions like Vanguard or other funds. For Buffet, (or other imaginary folks to whom power is handed and they are responsible with it) not requiring reporting or shifting of goals is probably fine. It's all the OTHER corporations that are a problem. You simply cannot rely on corporations to have someone like Buffet in power. Most don't. So most DO need to be doing self-analysis reporting of, say, what their diversity makeup looks like and how they can improve. Even picking board members in a political way -- trying to achieve diversity goals as well as talent -- doesn't seem like a terrible idea in the broader context of the corporate world beyond Berkshire, simply because most corporations do such a terrible job with those things if left to their own devices (Berkshire, on the other hand, does reasonably OK.)

For some people, it's life changing, for others they crack under the strain (potentially leading to the suicides of the models described in this book). Rose of the World's methods are developed from a scam/cult from the US called Lifespring.  
	% The one thing about this that gives me pause it a lot of what they describe sounds similar to the effects of LSD and psychedelics for breaking people down and allowing them to reach new insights about themselves. Nobody denies that Lifesprings methods are *powerful*. And has similar ctiticisms that have been leveled against psychedelics for decades.

  comment={The science behind the dangers of second hand smoking (and thus the justification for smoking bans) was deeply flawed, for reasons that are now standard in problematic science: "The first is that small sample sizes allowed random variances in data to be mistaken for real effects. The second is that most previous studies failed to account for existing downward trends in the rate of heart attacks. And the third is publication bias: Since no one believes that smoking bans increase heart attacks, few would bother submitting or publishing studies that show a positive correlation or null effect." This particular applies to findings that secondhand smoke increases the risk of heart attacks --- these findings disappear entirely in large-scale studies. But even lung disease risk is very low for secondhand smoke. (People who smoke cigarettes are, of course, still taking huge risks.) The article concludes by pointing out that this has implications for journalism: bad studies reporting wildly implausible positive health outcomes from smoking bans were picked up by the media.

We assessed post-cessation weight change and its contribution to the obesity epidemic in a general population in Norway. A total of 14,453 participants (52.6% women), aged 25–54 years in 1994, who attended at least two of four surveys in the Tromsø Study between 1994 and 2016, were included in the analysis. Hereof 77% participated in both the first and the last survey. Temporal trends in mean body mass index (BMI), prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and daily smoking were estimated with generalized estimation equations. We assessed BMI change by smoking status (ex-smoker, quitter, never smoker, daily smoker), and also under a scenario where none quit smoking. In total, the prevalence of daily smoking was reduced over the 21 years between Tromsø 4 (1994–1995) and Tromsø 7 (2015–2016) by 22 percentage points. Prevalence of obesity increased from 5 – 12% in 1994–1995 to 21–26% in 2015–2016, where obesity in the youngest (age 25–44 in 1994) increased more than in the oldest (p < 0.0001). Those who quit smoking had a larger BMI gain compared to the other three smoking subgroups over the 21 years (p < 0.0001). The scenario where none quit smoking would imply a 13% reduction in BMI gain in the population, though substantial age-related differences were noted. We conclude that smoking cessation contributed to the increase in obesity in the population, but was probably not the most important factor. Public health interventions should continue to target smoking cessation, and also target obesity prevention.},

In reality, lotteries bring in very small amounts of money that rarely impact the areas the money may be targeted towards (like education) and at the same time the public bedomes resistant to raising taxes to support those areas because they believe there's all this lottery money which doesn't exist. Meanwhile, lotteries regressively exploit poor people. Despite this, states lotteries have exploded, especiall scratcher tickets driven by the shady lobbing practices of the company S.G.I.

% The voucher thing really tips his hand as having an agenda rather than simply offering the type of critical analysis I appreciate. Why vouchers? School might be mostly day-care, but $15,000/year for high-quality day-care that includes educational programming is a good rate! What evidence is there that private institutions can provide better day-care with educational programming?  
% And why not just try to FIX the programming problems? How about music programs that teach kids to play the kinds of music that they actually will make use of as adults (rock and hiphop)? Why not start foreign-language training when children are younger and actually retain foreign languages? And the basics of civics, science, and government ARE learnable things --- most people who know them pick them up from reading the paper(he admits that adults do retain skills in reading, writing, and math because they use those things every day) --- so why not train kids to learn those things by engaging with media; instill a lifetime of learning about those things rather than just a couple of years of rote memorizing in school?

% I feel like this could be taken a step further than the educators here are arguing. I think the idea of putting kids on a topic they struggle with could be presented to them as a technique not just for learning, but for creating and even TEACHING (the teacher) --- someone who approaches a challenge with no prior conceptions of how to solve it is much more likely to come up with a creative new solution (out of the box thinking). The teacher could present themselves as curious to find out what the children come up with, rather than holding a solution in reserve that they aren't going to share until the children suffer a little first (you can see right there how it can easily be a litttle sadistic...)  
% I have long argued that no one, not college students, adults, or children, appreciates pedantic "well, how do you think that problem is solved?" kind of questions from someone who CLEARLY has a specific answer they believe is right and are waiting for you to discover. I think this style of teaching is abused by people with power over others. Teachers need to internalize the idea that they are learning WITH the children, not TEACHING them. The technique described in the article COULD be that, but could also be pedantic awfulness in a different teacher's hands.

  comment={Risk compensation (that is, if you make people feel safer, they take bigger risks) might exists in small moves humans make with their behavior, but overall it is never a serious factor  in safety. eg, seat belts and motorcycle helmets clearly save lives despite arguments that they would cause people to take bigger risks. Much of the scientific studies that supported risk compensation were deeply flawed. Oddly, the article argues both that experts use risk compensation as a concern (based on the idea that people are too dumb to adopt safe behaviors without taking riskier behaviors elsewhere -- eg masks in covid) and at the same time argues that the concept sticks around because it aligns with libertarian political ideology. Also anti-lock brakes had no overall effect on     reducing crashes (may or may not be related to risk compensation).},  
  category={Criticality, Transportation, Health, risk compensation, bicycle helmets, motorcycle helmets, seatbelts, covid masks}  
}  
% So... the authoritarian experts are hesitating to recommend public safety moves because they are libertarians? Something doesn't jibe there.  
% While the argument that risk compensation is basically an unsound theory not well supported by science and maintained by libertarian ideologies is in my mind a very strong position, there are actually a number of problems with this article:  
% The covid mask thing, I think, is MUCH more strongly explained by the complete idiotic misunderstanding of how respiratory diseases spread, where experts were ignoring their own science that they spread through air circulation. (Linked to, but quickly blown over in the artifle.) Risk compensation about wearing masks might have been a small part of it, but that was because the experts were worried people would stop washing their hands --- which at the time they thought was much more of a problem. Now they know that's minor compared to filtering your breathing. It wasn't the risk compensation behind their flawed decision making, it was their ow entrenched idiocy.  
% There's a lot going on in the world that _might_ be a more significant example of risk compensation: rugby players suffering far fewer injuries than much more heavily padded American football players; snowboarder deaths rising dramatically AFTER they all started wearing helmets. You could convince me these aren't risk compensation, per se, but _something_ crazy is going on.  
% In situations where the risk is already very low, factors get complex fast. It might not be risk compensation, but I still believe its so much better for your health to ride a bicycle every day even if you wear no helmet that the health factors far outweigh the slightly increased risk of riding without a helmet. FOUR riders have died in the 100+ year history of the tour de france --- most of that without helmets and with some of the most dangerous road riding you could do.  
% Overall, I'm entirely in favor of the core argument of this article. Particularly when you are talking about things that just so vastly improved safety there's no way risk compensation was _ever_ a factor, as in seatbelts, motorcycles helmets, and guardrails.  
% But I'm going to be pissed when someone brings this up to argue for bicycle helmets with me.  
% ...I find I keep thinking about this. And while I support the basic premise of the article: that far too many decisionmakers assume a power to risk aversion that is not there; I still think the issue is far too complicated to make proclamations like risk aversion is a bad idea.  
% First, there's just far too many oddball examples out there where the opposite result of some public health initiative was achieved. It seems like risk aversion _is_ real, it just doesn't have the impact and power that is often attributed to it. I don't think the article would disagree with this.  
% Where it gets fuzzier is in the ability to study this stuff. Like so much science that involves peopke, the modelverse the experiments have to be carried out in just don't reflect the complexity of the real world. Take those snowboarders. If you told me a study found that the snowboarders were given helmets and took similar risks to when they didn't have helmet on that day, I would totally believe you. But over the course of a _generation_ of snowboarders --- the previous generation having gone without helmets --- would there be a slow march into doing tricks in the death zone that is unhampered because snowboarders of the new generation have a vague sense of invulerability in their heavy gear? Would that generation have backed off from more extreme stunts when they or their friends started experience traumatic injuries at a far lower level of life-threatening danger if they had no protective gear?  
% The death zone concept comes into play here: like rock climbers getting above 40 feet, or cars moving faster than 40 mph (is there something special about 40?) Suddenly you go over a cliff of danger where the injuries become fatal, more or less regardless of protective gear. Does a new generation wearing protective gear learn to feel it's safe to enter that death zone? Even though it is objectively NOT. Even though they would be safer without protective gear if they remained out of the death zone?  
% It's that thing that the human body is evolved to sustain blows up to 20mph or so (a trip while running fast downhill). Gear that allows you to move beyond that, safety or otherwise, is what kills people.  
% There's also the fact that the _sensation_ of danger, whether perceieved or real, causes humans to behave more safely. Unquestionably, wider lanes cause people to drive faster. Narrower lanes make it _feel_ dangerous to drive faster, so people demonstrably don't. Aren't wider lanes causing risk compensation in this case?  
% I think it's a concept for which some criticality's time has come. But it's far too useful and complex and idea to dismiss it entirely.

  journal={The Baffler},  
  year={2014},  
  month={01},  
  comment={Graeber argues that science has been preoccupied since Darwin with the idea that all animal behavior has an evolutionary purpose, including play. This arises from the application of a capitalistic/economic world-view to the sciences: all animals are rational actors, driven by genes to maximise their chances of survival and reproduction. Graeber argues that this world-view flatly ignores the strong evidence that animals (not to mention humans) often behave irrationally, often to all appearances doing things just for the fun of it --- animals play. He then argues that this goes beyong just animal behavior, but in fact the idea of irrational behavior (and its foundation in consciousness) has to come from one of two places: either it "emerges" from dumb elemental particles stacking on top of eachother until poof a complex system pops up, _or_ there is some aspect of elemental particles themselves --- some tiny nuance that expresses randomness and irrationality --- that combines into consciousness at a higher level. Graeber takes the second possibility and runs with it, arguing that play could exist the entire way down the structural ladders of all species and objects to the fundamental root particles of the universe. He wraps up with the caveat that this stuff is very complex and he is not proposing that his view is _the_ solution, merely that it seems just as likely as the hyper-rational model that is currently unquestioned canon, and his view should at least be in the mix.},  
  category={Criticality, Economics, Science, fun, animal behavior}  
}  
% As terrific as this article is, and as much as I agree with the overarching critical concepts, he uses ant "mock" battles as an example of ants displaying play behavior. But EO Wilson lays out in The Ants 30 years before this article that those mock battles are not for fun, but a way for one colony to test the strength of another without destroying themselves. It may indeed be fun! But there's an easy-to-point-to rational reason for those mock battles.
% However, I do so often see scientists bending over backwards to cram strange animal behaviors into some kind of rational-actor evolutionary theory. From this comes much of the more complicated, fascinating, and counter-intuitive of the power of evolution! And... also sometimes ridiculous claims about why animals do things that scientists can't explain.

He suggests that the notion that capital is answerable to democracy is a result only of a short-lived and unique period in the first half to the 20th Century when capital needed nationalized labor due to the rise of the industrial revolution, and so allowed democracy to rise as a counterpoint to capital. He suggests that now democracy is well on the way to returning to a 17th-18th Century western style of structure: where capital is global (it was in the overseas companies like the Dutch East India Company then) and held almost exclusively by a few oligarchs. Those people reshaped the local government and economy to fit their needs, while not being answerable in any way to the people. This resulted in two economies: the local economy of everyday people and the global economy of the oligarchs. He calls these first and second economies respectively, and the second economy is almost entirely unanswerable to the first.},

Eating it is seen in the West as akin to an adventure sport, like skydiving, because of the deadly toxins in wild fugu. But most Japanese see it as sublimely delicious, and don't think about the toxins --- though the Japanese government has strictly regulated and tested fugu preparers in an effort to reduce the deaths caused by eating the fish. More interestingly, the article also talks about 'artisanal' food preparation. As farmed non-poisonous fugu brings fugu to more people, the art of preparing the deadly fish may fade away somewhat. But the article quotes American anthropologist Susan J. Terrio: "raft can serve as a metaphor for an alternative set of cultural values and work practices in contrast to the dominant norm, it becomes an ideological stance, a way for people to assert themselves against an increasingly corporatized, monocultural world. Still, it takes a certain amount of privilege to indulge in nostalgia for a more labor-intensive time. Much of this longing is for an imagined past in which every task in the production of food was intentional and joyous, rather than a matter of necessity. Such work only earned the label “artisanal” when it became a choice."},

% But she fails to acknowledge the problem with that: much unique language usage on campus is nothing more than signifiers of youth culture, that rapidly fade away. Think of "groovy" "rad" or "square". I'm not aruguing that this applies to singular 'they' --- that feels like it is so deeply embedded now that it isn't going anywhere. But some of the more out-there gender identifiers ("ze") seem unlikely to ever jump off campus, or beyond our current decade.

Also grass-fed beef produces more methane than corn/grain-fed beef, and grain-fed beef grow faster, so they are producing methane for less time.

}
% This was referenced in the Adam Curtis / Alan Moore panel talk: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lmhq-TYyRcY}
% Notes from that talk:
% * Counter-culture:
% 	* counter-culture is the way culture criticizes itself, and renews itself
% 	* stamping out counter-culture will lead to culture dying
% 	* counter-culture came of the 1960s failure to use politics to change the world
% 	* Individualism became big in the 60s because the generation before that said DON'T believe in mythologies --- look what happens: fascism, totalitarianism
% 	* Individualism cannot be put back in the bottle, but to achieve anything we need someone with a vision that people will follow
% 		* (This may not be relevant to argument here)
% 		* It lead to a great deal of selfishness and narcissim
% 		* We need something new, though based on the individual, because the opposite of that is fascism
% * Individualism:
% 	* what replaced it was you the individual use culture as a way to challenge culture.
% 		* you trust your own instincts, you are authentic, the man is fake
% 	* Being true to your individualism is the conformity of our time
% 	* It died in the 90s because it became the norm
% 	* we need a new kind of counterculture that goes the next step:
% 		* some kind of story that can unite us all, but also allows us to feel like we're in control of our destiny
% 		* that we're not going to be doing what the man tells us to do
% 	* Every individual needs to be their own leader: this is the only way we'll get the counter-culture we are looking for
% * The created reality:
% 	* See Adam Curtis article in the Guardian about South Park 
% 	* Reality can be whatever you want it to be (some of the most important figures in our world have reinvented characters)
% 	* computers disempower us by simplifying us: if you like this then you'll like that
% 		* they know nothing of our dreams
% 	* Places need to have mythos/stories told about them
% 	* Journalism is failing to tell those stories for lack of imagination. (Even on the left.)
% 	* It's just chaos, completely random events that are edited into the news studio until they find some sort of narrative, and then they call that 'reality'
% 	* It's not just the internet, there is no imagination in the way the world is told to us
% 		* It's not just about telling story, it's about telling you what it means.
% 			* That telling you what it means is controlled by think tanks now -- and they destroy everything
% 		* South Park (particularly imaginationland) tells you about what's happening in the world in a new way
% * The elites have been completely wrong about everything
% 	* The Trump election and Brexit was a big fuck-off button being pressed by the voters
% 	* But at least it showed elections DO have consequences
% 	* (This may not be relevant to argument here)
% * Conspiracy theories at least offer a vision/story that makes sense
% 	* That's a better alternative to us living in a bunch of random chaotic events and nobody understanding anything! 
% 	* The liberal disdain for conspiracy theories (only stupid people believe them) misses the point that conspiracy theories reveal that we don't understand the world --- in a way that the normal think-tank pushed "rational" journalism completely fails to do.
% 	* It is also reassuring to believe that monsters or gray aliens are running the world rather than that nobody is
% 	* Even though many who follow conspiracy theories know they aren't true, they are fascinated because they are a wonderfully entertaining dark alternative to the banality of the conventional media
% * Occupy and arab spring failed because while they knew how to organize, they didn't have a vision for what they wanted
% * We could get rid of the idea of nations now, and focus on our local communities, as a few hundred years ago people didn't know what country they lived in, only what village they came from
% * People create reality in their head, by putting together all the things around them.
% * If you live in a place that's a shithole, sooner or later you will feel like you are a shit
% * If you live in a place with a rich mythological landscape, you will feel empowered
% * Enrich places with their meaning --- meaning is the most important currency. It's what we lose when we don't have mythologies anymore. The meaning bleeds out of everything. Meaning has a half life. We need to restore meaning to things. Find meaning in everything, it will reempower the landscape around us
% * Does that sense of place lead to enmity against others?
% * Curtis holds out Rojava Syria as an example
% * Our media, politicians, those in power, are drama queens who push a continual sense of crisis, and this puts off any thought about the future
% * Whereas in Rojava, where there is REAL crisis, they actually spend their time thinking about the future
% * (And now, with covid, is that different?)
% * New journalism: no objectivity is impossible, so accepting subjectivity is more honest. We need some of that.
% 	* It was part of the rise of individualism, but it petered out sometime in the 1990s.
% * Now we're just waiting for a new kind of journalism. People want stories. We want to know what's going on. But nobody tells us.
% * It used to be that journalists tell stories about terrible things, everyone gets mad about it, and the politicians do something about it.
% 	* But this broke in the 90s sometime --- now journalists tells stories about something awful and all the individuals shrug and nothing happens.
% * Everything is up for grabs now, it's wide open for powerful emotional stories that make sense of everything, we should be optimistic about the future.

The claim of negligence was based on the premise that an alternative (non-invasive) test should have been used because it carried a lower risk. The case raises a number of general and widely applicable concerns about the decision-making process within the medical profession, including the ethics of informed consent, patient care liabilities when errors are made, and the research problem of focusing on ‘true positives’ while ignoring ‘false positives’. An immediate concern is how best to present Bayesian arguments in such a way that they can be understood by people who would normally balk at mathematical equations. We feel it is possible to present purely visual representations of a non-trivial Bayesian argument in such a way that no mathematical knowledge or understanding is needed. The approach supports a wide range of alternative scenarios, makes all assumptions easily understandable and offers significant potential benefits to many areas of medical decision-making.}

  comment={These researchers find that mindfulness meditation "a Buddhism-inspired practice in which you focus your mind entirely on the current moment" decreases the motivation of workers. This is because mindfulness makes a person more relaxed and calm, and at peace with the current status of things. Motivation generally arises from the desire the _change_ things, implying the person is not at peace. Their research finds that people who meditate are more relaxed and less at peace and therefore less productive. Similar to taking a nap during the work day, the worker might feel better, but not very inspired to do grunt work.},

 abstract = {Despite growing enthusiasm, there is little empirical evidence on how well energy efficiency investments work. Evidence is particularly lacking from low- and middle-income countries, despite a widespread view that these countries have many of the best opportunities. This paper evaluates a field experiment in Mexico in which a quasi-experimental sample of new homes was provided with insulation and other energy-efficient upgrades. A novel feature of our study is that we deploy large numbers of data loggers which allow us to measure temperature and humidity at high frequency inside homes. We find that the upgrades had no detectable impact on electricity use or thermal comfort, with essentially identical temperature and humidity levels in upgraded and non-upgraded homes. These results stand in sharp contrast to the engineering estimates that predicted up to a 26% decrease in electricity use. Part of the explanation is that air conditioner ownership is lower than expected, thus reducing the potential for reductions in energy use. In addition, we document that most households have their windows open on hot days, nullifying the thermal benefits of roof and wall insulation. Overall, we conclude that the benefits from these investments are unlikely to exceed the costs, which added $400-$500 USD to the cost of each home. Our results underscore the urgent need to fully incorporate socioeconomic conditions and human behavior into engineering models of energy use.},  
 comment = {``Our results add to a growing number of analyses that find ex post energy savings well below engineering estimates. See, e.g., Davis et al. (2014); Levinson (2016); Fowlie et al.  (forthcoming). In our case, the differences stem from low penetration of air conditioning, one of the key sources of energy savings in the engineering estimates. In addition, we document that most households have windows open during the summer, making building insulation and the other energy-efficiency investments less effective than predicted by the model.''  ``our results point to the urgent need to fully incorporate socioeconomic conditions and human behavior into engineering models.''},

% The implication of the headline is that another woman on the tour called the  police because they were Native Americans.

%   
% Metalheads are not a protected class, but the police are called to confront them all the time based on nothing more than how they dress. There is prejudice against Muslims because of the perception that they are a terrorist threat, and there is (very rightly) a huge effort to address that prejudice. I think there's probably just as much prejudice against metalheads because of the perception that they might become an active shooter threat. But where is the effort to address this prejudice?  
  
% It would be fascinating to have someone go ask these brothers why THEY thought the police were called on them. It's a chance to unpack the actual fears of the culture against the national narrative of fear.

But while we recognize and make at least cosmetic efforts to address the darker aspects of gentrification, we have forgotten or marginalized the in-your-face, in-the-streets activists of the LGBT left.'' ``The legalization of same-sex vows is another step in the monetization of all human encounter. Under capitalism, love, like everything else that was once sacred, has become inextricably entangled with Social Security perks and property transfers and thirty-thousand-dollar weddings accompanied by prenuptial agreements written in anticipation of divorce. When its advocates spoke of marriage as a civil right, they were speaking not of love, which remains mercifully and always indifferent to the law, but of property—its smooth acquisition and tax-free disposition, the many advantages it affords, one might say, to the married.'' ``How is Earth’s situation today different from that of a person with ­AIDS in 1985? Capital, backed by a growing and ever more heavily armed police force trained to shoot, so thoroughly monitors and controls every expression of resistance that the violent demonstrations of the 1960s come helplessly to mind. Our current political crisis arouses a dark urge to respond to the rhetorical violence of Donald Trump with the literal violence it encourages. Would the Vietnam War have ended without riots on campuses? Would African Americans have made any progress without the burning of cities?

American children's educational output has grown steeply over the past 30 years. ``In 2013, an article appeared in The Atlantic with the title, “My Daughter’s Homework Is Killing Me.” The writer, Karl Taro Greenfeld, had attempted to complete the homework of his daughter, an eighth grader at a selective New York public school, to discover the exact nature of the labor that was keeping her up every night. He quickly found that he wasn’t prepared to keep up: Imagine if after putting in a full day at the office — and school is pretty much what our children do for a job — you had to come home and do another four or so hours of office work. . . . If your job required that kind of work after work, how long would you last?'' ``The sad truth, however, is that college admissions are designed to funnel young adults onto different tracks, not to validate hard work. A jump in the number of Harvard-caliber students doesn’t have a corresponding effect on the size of the school’s freshman class. Instead, it allows the university to become even more selective and to raise prices, to stock up on geniuses and rich kids. This is the central problem with an education system designed to create the most human capital possible: an increase in ability within a competitive system doesn’t advantage all individuals.'' ``If more human capital automatically led to a higher standard of living, this model could be the foundation for an American meritocracy. But millennials’ extra work hasn’t earned them the promised higher standard of living. By every metric, this generation is the most educated in American history, yet its members are worse off economically than their parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents.

% The early Christian empire may have served it's communistic members in a just way, but it leaves behind everyone who is not part of the commune.  
% There is no social justice in saying that only IF you are part of our communistic system there will be justice for you. All others can suffer with the abuses of the conventional system.  
% It's nice to share property equally among all the members of a community, but you aren't really addressing _justice_ until you are sharing property among all the members of a _society_.

Stores have to remove plastic packaging from items before selling them. This is part of why Rwanda is Africa's cleanest nation and among the cleanest in the world. Though it has also led to a strong smugglers market for plastic bags, and the bags being smuggled into the country like drugs in the US, and enforced like drug crimes, with severe sentences and public shaming. This article points out that in the US and Europe this might not be achievable because ``there is a dispute between environmentalists and representatives of the plastic industry who say that bags made of alternative materials, like cloth, have a bigger carbon footprint than plastic ones and aren’t as environmentally friendly as people think.'' Of course this doesn't change the fact that Rwanda is sparkling clean.},

Most cases are settled through plea bargaining, not court - despite what you see on TV. ``our criminal justice system is almost exclusively a system of plea bargaining, negotiated behind closed doors and with no judicial oversight. The outcome is very largely determined by the prosecutor alone.'' In 2013 8 percent of federal charges were dismissed, 97 percent were plead, and just 3 percent went to trial. In most states 95 percent of felony charges are plead. In most other countries plea bargains are not a common tool. Even after plea bargaining became common after the Civil War, it mostly could still be seen as honest, until the increasing crime of the 1980s led to stiffer sentences. This created pressure for defendents to avoid trial and the maximum sentence. And this, in turn, has led to many people pleading guilty to crimes they didn't commit.},

This creates social signaling --- families that see what other families do that works, want to try that too. Miller's program is called the Family Independence Initiative. He talks about how the war on poverty began as movements, then grew into programs. But many of those programs reinforce a paternalistic notion, and become programs that people avoid for the sense of indignity they bring. People who are at conferences on poverty don't represent themselves, they represent the success of a _program_ in order to justify funding for that program.

Some studies find that devout believers live more morally upright lives, compared with nonbelievers; others find no differences at all. The research is plagued by differing definitions of what moral behavior is and what constitutes true religious devotion (e.g., self-identification, or daily ritual?). Even the definition of nonbelief is a moving target: A person may identify as atheist, agnostic, “lapsed” or merely indifferent depending on his or her mood and understanding of those terms. The urge to impute beliefs, motives and mental states to mass murderers, moreover, is often misplaced, experts said. Some mass killers clearly commit atrocities because of their professed religious beliefs, like terrorists. But modern history’s register of assorted serial killers, spree shooters and other mortal predators is a rogue’s gallery of mostly male, aggrieved actors who are sometimes believers, sometimes not, and who half the time do not qualify for any specific psychiatric diagnosis, as disturbed as they are, according an analysis of more than 200 such killers by Dr. Michael Stone, a New York forensic psychiatrist.

You’d call yourself a Marxist, a neoconservative, a Freudian, an existentialist or a New Deal liberal.'' ``People today seem less likely to give themselves intellectual labels or join self-conscious philosophical movements. Young people today seem more likely to have their worldviews shaped by trips they have taken, or causes they have been involved in, or the racial or ethnic or gender identity group they identify with.'' ``In his book, “The Ideas Industry,” Daniel W. Drezner says we’ve shifted from a landscape dominated by public intellectuals to a world dominated by thought leaders. A public intellectual is someone like Isaiah Berlin, who is trained to comment on a wide array of public concerns from a specific moral stance. A thought leader champions one big idea to improve the world — think Al Gore’s work on global warming.'' ``As Drezner puts it, intellectuals are critical, skeptical and tend to be pessimistic. Thought leaders are evangelists for their idea and tend to be optimistic.'' There used to be a sense that the very nature of society was up for grabs, but now public thinkers see themselves as legislative advisers. While public policy used to be guided by frameworks politicians operated in which was created by intellectuals, now the itellectuals simply provide policy guidance in an effort to change one thing.},

  comment={Covers the history of the rise of Wikipedia, and the decline in the last decade as aggressive old-school editors have made it hard for new people to start editing. Also caused partially by the efforts to cut down on vandalism. This has led to a sharp decline in the number of active editors. And a professionalization of those voluteer editors and at the same time a weak representation of articles from non-Western non-white perspectives. The volunteer editors themselves blame the lack of newbies on "policy creep" citing the 5000-word neutral point of view policy. There's also some thought given to the idea that the ideals of the early internet are fading or being lost: ``Indeed, larger cultural trends will probably make it a challenge to appeal to a broader section of the public. As commercial websites have risen to prominence, online life has moved away from open, self-governed crowdsourcing communities like the one that runs Wikipedia, says Clay Shirky, a professor in the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University. Shirky was one of the biggest boosters of an idea, popular during the previous decade, that the Web encouraged strangers to come together and achieve things impossible for a conventional organization. Wikipedia is proof there was some truth to that notion. But today’s Web is dominated by sites such as Facebook and Twitter, where people maintain personal, egocentric feeds. Outside specific settings like massive multiplayer games, relatively few people mingle in shared virtual space. Instead, they use mobile devices that are unsuited to complex creative work and favor neatly self-­contained apps over messier, interconnected Web pages. Shirky, who is an advisor to the Wikimedia Foundation, says people steeped in that model will struggle to understand how and why they should contribute to Wikipedia or any project like it. “Facebook is the largest participatory culture today, but their mode of participation is different,” he says. “It’s aggregating rather than collaborating.”'' Also compares Wikipedia to a public park: ``Gardner agrees that today’s Web is hostile to self-organized collective efforts, likening it to a city that has lost its public parks. “Our time is spent on an increasingly small number of increasingly large corporate sites,” she says. “We need more public space online.” In fact, Gardner is leaving the foundation at the end of the year in search of new projects to work on that very problem. She contends that even with all its troubles, Wikipedia is one of the Web’s few public parks that won’t disappear.''},

% Doesn't address the fact that so much of wikipedia is now edited by experts that it can be hard to read some articles for being too technical. I have thought for a long time that Wikipedia should have a policy of putting a plain-language description at the top of every article.  
% Also, while it does say that the efforts to address vandalism were mostly successful, it generally subscribes to the criticism that Wikipedia is often wrong. Sure it is, but it deserves credit for how GOOD and RIGHT it is too.  
% As I say, it is obviously a mistake to cite Wikipedia for your academic paper, but you are a fool to not check the wikipedia article about whatever subject you are researching.

And how Boston was trying to find potholes with a smartphone app that detected them with accelerometers, but had to supplement that data with government vehicles driven in neighborhoods with low smartphone usage. ``We can think of this as a “signal problem”: Data are assumed to accurately reflect the social world, but there are significant gaps, with little or no signal coming from particular communities.'' ``Big data’s signal problems won’t disappear as the use of smartphones and other digital technologies increases. As the geographers Michael Crutcher and Matthew Zook noted after Hurricane Katrina, technologies are always differentially adopted, and “any divide in accessing digital technology is not a one-time event but a constantly moving target as new devices, software and cultural practices emerge.” As we move into an era in which personal devices are seen as proxies for public needs, we run the risk that already existing inequities will be further entrenched. Thus, with every big data set, we need to ask which people are excluded. Which places are less visible? What happens if you live in the shadow of big data sets?  This points to the next frontier: how to address these weaknesses in big data science. In the near term, data scientists should take a page from social scientists, who have a long history of asking where the data they’re working with comes from, what methods were used to gather and analyze it, and what cognitive biases they might bring to its interpretation (for more, see “Raw Data is an Oxymoron“).''},

"For most epicures, it is almost an article of faith that this will never happen, because food needs to be cooked with love, flair and passion. While this might conceivably be true at the very peak of culinary art, in most cases mechanisation is competing not against the artisanal best but against the human mean. So, even if the very best coffee is still made the traditional way by a skilled, human barista, all Nespresso need do is produce better coffee than the majority of baristas, whom most coffee fanatics describe as incompetent anyway." "Surely we appreciate the handmade in part because it is handmade. An object or a meal has different meaning and significance if we know it to be the product of a human being working skilfully with tools rather than a machine stamping out another clone. Even if in some ways a mass-produced object is superior in its physical properties, we have good reasons for preferring a less perfect, handcrafted one." "Corporations know this, which is why they will often use bogus personalisation to make their products seem more appealing, like putting a picture of a farmer on the label, or giving the product the name of a person or place. But do we have good reasons for this preference, or is it just romantic nonsense? I think we do. We live in a world of humans, other animals and things, and the quality of life depends on the qualities of the relationships between them. Mass production, like factory farming, weakens, if not destroys, these relationships. This creates a kind of alienation, where we feel no genuine, human contact with those who supply us with what we need."},

In the present study, the Arctic Ocean was extensively sampled for floating plastic debris from the Tara Oceans circumpolar expedition. Although plastic debris was scarce or absent in most of the Arctic waters, it reached high concentrations (hundreds of thousands of pieces per square kilometer) in the northernmost and easternmost areas of the Greenland and Barents seas. The fragmentation and typology of the plastic suggested an abundant presence of aged debris that originated from distant sources. This hypothesis was corroborated by the relatively high ratios of marine surface plastic to local pollution sources. Surface circulation models and field data showed that the poleward branch of the Thermohaline Circulation transfers floating debris from the North Atlantic to the Greenland and Barents seas, which would be a dead end for this plastic conveyor belt. Given the limited surface transport of the plastic that accumulated here and the  
mechanisms acting for the downward transport, the seafloor beneath this Arctic sector is hypothesized as an important sink of plastic debris.},

I could have tried to tell you this story in the form of an image-based Snapchat story, but it would most likely have been unwieldy and not especially informative. If you want to convey a lot of information concisely and accurately, writing is still one of the best methods to use.  “If you’ve ever looked at Ikea instructions, those don’t have any words in them, and they’re notorious for how frustrating they are to use,” Ms. McCulloch said. “Ikea instructions would be a lot nicer if they came with words.

However, status competition is also associated with excessive expenditure on status goods, greater likelihood of bankruptcy, and more risk taking by money managers. This paper examines the effects of recognition and status competition jointly. In particular, we focus on the spillover effects of public recognition on the performance and risk taking of peers. Using newly collected data on monthly “victory” scores of more than 5,000 German pilots during World War II, we find that status competition had important effects: After the German armed forces bulletin mentioned the accomplishments of a particular fighter pilot, his former peers performed considerably better. This outperformance varied across skill groups. When a former squadron peer was mentioned, the best pilots tried harder, scored more, and died no more frequently; in contrast, average pilots won only a few additional victories but died at a significantly higher rate. Hence our results show that the overall efficiency effect of nonfinancial rewards can be ambiguous in settings where both risk and output affect aggregate performance.},

For decades, global events seemed to support that idea. Data from Freedom House, a watchdog organization that measures democracy and freedom around the world, shows that the number of countries classified as “free” rose steadily from the mid-1970s to the early 2000s. Many Latin American countries transitioned from military rule to democracy; after the end of the Cold War, much of Eastern Europe followed suit. And longstanding liberal democracies in North America, Western Europe and Australia seemed more secure than ever.'' This research created an index of democratic stability and their index suggest that Western democracies are weakening. The research suffers from a correlation vs causation problem, and it is only one measure.

% The Democrats lost because they ran a candidate who completely failed to present any kind of vision against establishment politics. Presenting as anti-establishment is what won every election since 2000. It's why Bush won, it's why Obama won, and it's why Trump won. (Or maybe more importantly NOT presenting as anti-establishment is why Gore, Kerry, Romney, and Clinton LOST.)

The argument is that Indians were primarily a communal culture, while Europeans were more atomized. ``If colonial culture was relatively atomized, imagine American culture of today. As we’ve gotten richer, we’ve used wealth to buy space: bigger homes, bigger yards, separate bedrooms, private cars, autonomous lifestyles. Each individual choice makes sense, but the overall atomizing trajectory sometimes seems to backfire. According to the World Health Organization, people in wealthy countries suffer depression by as much as eight times the rate as people in poor countries.'' ``If millennials are heading anywhere, it seems to be in the direction of community.

Most striking was the finding that white males tended to differ from everyone else in their attitudes and perceptions–on average, they perceived risks as much smaller and much more acceptable than did other people.

  category = {Criticality, rock and roll, the beatles, chuck berry, bob dylan, elvis, sousa}  
}  
% Klosterman quote jazz historian Ted Gioia who believes that specialists are the people who galvanize history. Critics have almost no impact on what music is popular at any given time, but they’re extraordinarily well positioned to dictate what music is reintroduced after its popularity has waned: ``critics and music historians hate sentimental love songs. They’ve constructed a perspective that emphasizes the rise of rock and pushes everything else into the background. Transgressive rockers, in contrast, enjoy lasting fame.''   
% ``He points to a contemporary version of that phenomenon: “Right now, electronic dance music probably outsells hip‑hop. This is identical to the punk‑versus‑disco trade‑off of the 1970s. My prediction: edgy hip‑hop music will win the fame game in the long run, while E.D.M. will be seen as another mindless dance craze.”''   
% ``His example is the adversarial divide between punk and disco: In 1977, the disco soundtrack to “Saturday Night Fever” and the Sex Pistols’ “Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols” were both released. The soundtrack to “Saturday Night Fever” has sold more than 15 million copies; it took “Never Mind the Bollocks” 15 years to go platinum. Yet virtually all pop historiographers elevate the importance of the Pistols above that of the Bee Gees. The same year the Sex Pistols finally sold the millionth copy of their debut, SPIN magazine placed them on a list of the seven greatest bands of all time. “Never Mind the Bollocks” is part of the White House record library, supposedly inserted by Amy Carter just before her dad lost to Ronald Reagan. The album’s reputation improves by simply existing: In 1985, the British publication NME classified it as the 13th‑greatest album of all time; in 1993, NME made a new list and decided it now deserved to be ranked third. This has as much to do with its transgressive identity as its musical integrity. The album is overtly transgressive (and therefore memorable), while “Saturday Night Fever” has been framed as a prefab totem of a facile culture (and thus forgettable). For more than three decades, that has been the overwhelming consensus.''   
% ``But I’ve noticed — just in the last four or five years — that this consensus is shifting. Why? Because the definition of “transgressive” is shifting. It’s no longer appropriate to dismiss disco as superficial. More and more, we recognize how disco latently pushed gay, urban culture into white suburbia, which is a more meaningful transgression than going on a British TV talk show and swearing at the host.''   
% Klosterman points out that Johnny B. Goode is on the song on Voyager though. (Against Alan Lomax's wishes.) Here Comes the Sun was floated, all four Beatles wanted it, but none of them owned the copyright so it was killed for legal reasons.

  abstract = { Racial capitalism — the process of deriving social and economic value from racial identity — is a longstanding, common, and deeply problematic practice. This Article is the first to identify racial capitalism as a systemic phenomenon and to undertake a close examination of its causes and consequences.  The Article focuses on instances of racial capitalism in which white individuals and predominantly white institutions use nonwhite people to acquire social and economic value. Affirmative action doctrine and policies provide much of the impetus for this form of racial capitalism. These doctrines and policies have fueled an intense legal and social preoccupation with the notion of diversity, which encourages white individuals and predominantly white institutions to engage in racial capitalism by deriving value from nonwhite racial identity. An examination of the consequences of racial capitalism is particularly timely given the Supreme Court’s pending decision in Fisher v. University of Texas, a challenge to the affirmative action policy at the University of Texas.  Racial capitalism has serious negative consequences both for individuals and for society as a whole. The process of racial capitalism relies upon and reinforces commodification of racial identity, which degrades that identity by reducing it to another thing to be bought and sold. Commodification can also foster racial resentment by causing nonwhite people to feel used or exploited by white people. And the superficial value assigned to nonwhiteness within a system of racial capitalism displaces measures that would lead to meaningful social reform.  In an ideal society, racial capitalism would not occur. Given the imperfections of our current society, however, this Article instead proposes a pragmatic approach to dismantling racial capitalism, one that recognizes that progress must occur incrementally. Under such an approach, we would discourage racial capitalism. But if racial capitalism did occur, we would identify it explicitly, call attention to its harms, and impose penalties on those who engage in racial capitalism. Moreover, we should ensure that any transaction involving racial value is structured so as to discourage future racial capitalism. I briefly survey some of the various legal mechanisms that can be deployed to discourage racial capitalism through limited commodification. Ultimately, this approach will allow progress toward a society in which we successfully recognize and respect racial identity without engaging in racial capitalism.},

In such situations individuals can exhibit both primacy bias towards the first option and recency bias towards the last option.  We examine this phenomenon in a particularly interesting context: consumer response to the ordering of economics papers in an email announcement issued by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).  Each Monday morning Eastern Standard Time (EST) the NBER issues a “New This Week” (NTW) email that lists all of the working papers that have been issued in the past week.  This email goes to more than 23,000 subscribers, both inside and outside academia, and the placement order is based on random factors.  We show that despite the randomized list placement, papers that are listed first each week are about 30% more likely to be viewed, downloaded, and cited over the next two years.  Lower ranking on the list leads to fewer views and downloads, but not cites; however, there is also some recency bias, with the last paper listed receiving more views, downloads and cites.  The results are robust to a wide variety of specification checks and are present for both all viewers/downloaders, and for academic institutions in particular.   These results suggest that even among expert searchers, list-based searches can be manipulated by list placement.},
