# List of Fat Nonfiction Page-turners 
I don't know if there is an official name for this category of books,
but if I have a favorite genre of books it is this: big fat non-fiction
books meticulously researched, written in an accessible and compelling
style, usually bounded by some kind of giant story arc. Is it not
narrative non-fiction, which is (in the best case) things like _In Cold
Blood_ where it is written as a novel. (I actually have little tolerance
for most narrative non-fiction.) It is not just "non-fiction," which
could be _anything_ from slogging academic texts to self-help books.
And it doesn't include books like _Devil in the White City_, which may
have been striving to be counted among the books on this list but falls
(far) short in its descent into sensationalism and lack of real insight.
I don't think there is a name for this category of books, but maybe
if I start putting a list down a name will present itself. Whatever
we call it, this list is very closely mapped to my list of all-time
favorite books (though missing, obviously, the novels I love and more
explanatory texts like _Essence of Decision_. One thing I have noted
about these books is they tend to be written by people who were trained
as journalists. Make of that what you will. I also notice they tend
to be written by white dudes -- but hopefully that is a reflection of
the fact that I usually discover these books when they are approaching
the decades-old mark and thus publishing was even more in the grip of
systemic racism then than it is now, rather than a reflection of my own
tastes.

## They are fat, they are compelling, they are fascinating: nonfiction page-turners:
1. The Power Broker
2. The Last Place on Earth
3. The Gun
4. Fatal Shore
5. Rise and Fall of the Third Reich
6. Son of the Morning Star
7. Rising Tide
8. The Guns of August
9. The Modernist City
10. (Nature's Metropolis)
	* (This one is actually a little too instructive/explanatory to be fully included in this list. That's not a criticism -- the best parts of the book are the instructive parts -- just that it leans towards the academic text side of things rather than the narrative side. But is unquestionable a great (fat) book.)
11. (For God, Country, and Coca-Cola)
	* (Maybe? I read it a very long time ago and I don't remember exactly how good it was.)
