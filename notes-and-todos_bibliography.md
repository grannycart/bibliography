# Bibliography --- notes and todos

## Things to do
* [X] Figure out if bibliography should really be it's own repo:
	* Yes, this is pretty easy, just add it to the repo, and change the source in settings for the repo
	* See this stuff about changing the publishing source:
		* https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites
* [X] Finish break out by sections and experiments to see how github pages renders bib style
* [ ] Do something to make blank entries less prominent
* [ ] Put default style yaml at top of Bibliography topic subpages
* [ ] Add descriptions for each topic of what that topic covers
* [ ] Write up a disclaimer in README about how this is fairly raw first impressions, not researched or intended for publication
* [-] Update README for bibliography.git (if this all works) to say it is no longer being used and is just for archival purposes
	* Don't need to do this since I'm using the project pages now
* [ ] Add a post to newsforxala that more reading can be found here.
* [X] When finished pasting in entries, check them side by side to see if the line counts match and they are the same
	* (That is, be sure to not lose anything.)
