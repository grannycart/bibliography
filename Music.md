        abstract = {Spatial hearing is a crucial capacity of the auditory system. While the encoding of horizontal sound direction has  
been extensively studied, very little is known about the representation of vertical sound direction in the auditory cortex. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured voxel-wise sound elevation tuning curves in human auditory cortex and show that sound elevation is represented by broad tuning functions preferring lower elevations as well as secondary narrow tuning functions preferring individual elevation directions. We changed the ear shape of participants (male and female) with silicone molds for several days. This manipulation reduced or abolished the ability to discriminate sound elevation and flattened cortical tuning curves. Tuning curves recovered their original shape as participants adapted to the modified ears and regained elevation perception over time. These  
findings suggest that the elevation tuning observed in low-level auditory cortex did not arise from the physical features of the stimuli, but is contingent on experience with spectral cues and covaries with the change in perception. One explanation for this observation  
may be that the tuning in low-level auditory cortex underlies the subjective perception of sound elevation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis study addresses two fundamental questions about the brain representation of sensory stimuli: how the vertical spatial axis of auditory space is represented in the auditory cortex, and whether low-level sensory cortex represents physical stimulus features or subjective perceptual attributes. Using high-resolution fMRI we show that vertical sound direction is represented by broad tuning functions preferring lower elevations as well as secondary narrow tuning functions preferring individual elevation directions. In addition, we demonstrate that the shape of these tuning functions is contingent on experience with spectral cues and covaries with the change in perception, which may indicate that the tuning functions in low-level auditory cortex underlie the perceived elevation of a sound source.},

While there is a tradition of connecting popular music with sociology, this article posits a further resonance that is not so much theoretical as methodological. The article suggests that forms of contemporary popular music parallel key facets of ethnography, not simply in terms of sociological analysis, but with regard to popular music as an ethnographic resource, as ‘data’, and as the reflexive expression of Paul Willis’ conception of the ‘ethnographic imagination’; and the article argues that contemporary British hip-hop in the form of ‘grime’ is a potent exemplar. This is due to the resolutely cultural, spatial nature of grime music: a factor that marks out grime as a distinctive musical genre and a distinctive ethnographic form, as it is an experientially rooted music about urban locations, made from within those urban locations. },

Covers Kraftwerk's influential history, including being picked up by Afrika Bambaataa to create Planet Rock, and other modern pop songs. Also talks about their early history and shift from Krautrock into electronic music for everyone. ``What carried the retrospective, and kept it from being a period piece, was the sound. It was relatively quiet, as pop-music performance goes, and Hütter explained that it was like classical music for him; hearing detail was important, and there needed to be room for dynamic surges and drops. Hearing the rippling, atonal arpeggios of “Numbers” or the almost demure tootling of “Neon Lights” made it seem as if Kraftwerk’s influence on contemporary music might never end. Every fragment of language—“It’s in the air for you and me,” for instance—and every lullaby melody could be dropped, without change, into any modern pop song and sound appropriate to even the savviest listener.''},

% I remember being at this show and thinking: "It makes sense that they are in this museum. They ARE museum pieces - MoMA gives them the legitimacy they always should have had for the influence they had. But they are not creating NEW music that is shifting the landscape anymore. Not that there's anything wrong with that."  
% Also, as Frere-Jones points out, this show was the BEST sounding show I have ever been too. It was astonishingly crisp. There was SO much detail you could hear.  
% It's one of the things I love about Kraftwerk; their production quality. They are one of the few bands I like that justify having expensive stereo equipment. Not that there's anything wrong with poor production. But high-quality production is its own art to be appreciated when it's there.

  date={2016-07-04},  
  comment = {Raises the claim that there is no such thing as music with universal appeal (that is a concept that arose only in the last few hundred years) and makes the argument that music is inherently powerful and just as easy to use for violence as for peace. ``To quote the standard platitudes, it has charms to soothe a savage breast; it is the food of love; it brings us together and sets us free. We resist evidence suggesting that music can cloud reason, stir rage, cause pain, even kill. Footnoted treatises on the dark side of music are unlikely to sell as well as the cheery pop-science books that tout music’s ability to make us smarter, happier, and more productive.'' ``A genre that enrages one person may have a placebo effect on another. A 2006 study by the psychologist Laura Mitchell, testing how music-therapy sessions can alleviate pain, found that a suffering person was better served by his or her “preferred music” than by a piece that was assumed to have innately calming qualities. In other words, music therapy for a heavy-metal fan should involve heavy metal, not Enya.'' ``Beginning in the nineteen-fifties, programs that trained American soldiers and intelligence operatives to withstand torture had a musical component; at one point, the playlist reportedly included the industrial band Throbbing Gristle and the avant-garde vocalist Diamanda Galás.'' ``The soldiers told Pieslak that they used music to strip themselves of empathy. One said that he and his comrades sought out a “predator kind of music.” Another, after admitting with some embarrassment that Eminem’s “Go to Sleep” (“Die, motherfucker, die”) was a “theme song” for his unit, said, “You’ve got to become inhuman to do inhuman things.” The most unsettling choice was Slayer’s “Angel of Death,” which imagines the inner world of Josef Mengele: “Auschwitz, the meaning of pain / The way that I want you to die.” Such songs are far removed from uplifting wartime propaganda like “Over There,” the patriotic 1917 tune by George M. Cohan. The image of soldiers prepping for a mission by listening to Metallica’s “One”—“Landmine has taken my sight . . . Left me with life in hell”—suggests the degree to which they, too, felt trapped in a malevolent machine.'' ``German thinkers in the idealist and Romantic tradition—Hegel, E.T.A. Hoffmann, and Schopenhauer, among others—sparked a drastic revaluation of music’s significance. It became the doorway to the infinitude of the soul, and expressed humanity’s collective longing for freedom and brotherhood. With the canonization of Beethoven, music became the vehicle of genius. Sublime as Beethoven is, the claim of universality blended all too easily with a German bid for supremacy. The musicologist Richard Taruskin, whose rigorously unsentimental view of Western music history anchors much recent work in the field, likes to quote a phrase ironically articulated by the historian Stanley Hoffman, who died last year: “There are universal values, and they happen to be mine.”''},

% In the paper magazine this article was called: The Sound of Hate  
% There's a lot of interesting ideas in this article, but the central thesis is deeply flawed. I'm sure it's possible to use SOUND as a weapon --- to cause deafness presumably. That would not be different than using lasers to blind people.   
% But the ``weapons'' that use sounds are usually trying to be non-permanent damaging. And those seem to be not entirely effective. I'm not sure the Mosquito device to chase away teenagers isn't any less of a scam than the devices that are supposed to chase away actual mosquitoes.  
% And the sound machines that are supposed to disperse crowds, I heard recently, were complete ineffective against Black Lives Matter protesters. And presumably didn't work very well against Occupy Wall Street either.  
% And that is not MUSIC those machines just make sound. There is little to no evidence that MUSIC is in any way a more effective torture or violence device than NOISE.   
% I think the more truthful conclusion is that music you like IS soothing, and what you like is not universal. But there is very little evidence that music can be used AGAINST someone.

Prince figured them out, devising a new brand of dance music based on a heretofore unheard-of idea: that synthesizer and drum machines could carry a sweaty funk groove as forcefully as guitars and drums and brass sections had.'' ``Today, it’s striking how much more adventurous Prince’s records were than those of fellow ’80s titans — including his chief friendly nemesis, Michael Jackson. Some of his singles even took dead aim at those rivals. “Raspberry Beret” played like a funky, libidinous sendup of Bruce Springsteen’s Heartland road songs. (“I put her on the back of my bike/And we went riding/Down by Old Man Johnson’s farm.”) The astounding guitar work on the “Purple Rain” soundtrack seemed directed at Jackson, who had muscled up his music on hits like “Beat It.” The point was unmistakable: If Michael Jackson wanted a rip-roaring guitar solo, he had to corral Eddie Van Halen and pay him a generous day rate. Prince could peel off the solo himself, presumably in between orgies.''},
