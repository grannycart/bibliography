    % While employees at big Chinese technology companies are limited to collaborating with colleagues, “if you work on open source, you work with talent around the world,”  
    % Many executives and pundits have argued that the big U.S. companies should not open source their technologies because they could be used to spread disinformation or cause other serious harm. Some U.S. lawmakers have explored the possibility of preventing or throttling the practice.  
    % But if the best open source technologies come from China, they argue, U.S. developers will build their systems atop those technologies. In the long-run, that could put China at the heart of A.I. research and development.  
    % Hours after his inauguration, President Trump rescinded a Biden administration executive order that threatened to curb open source technologies.
