% Page 42: The internet is one giant copy machine, everything is a copy: "The difference between 'streaming' and 'downloading' is whether your program gives you a 'Save as' button."  
% Page 51: Any service on the internet that allows people to have conversations with each other is going to result in social conversation --- even though the early internet was built to talk science, it rapidly also included discussions of Star Trek. Social conversation exists all over the internet _alongside_ "content".  
    % This page finally tipped off what I didn't understand about tiktok: tiktok finally (after years of trying) enabled people to have social conversations on the internet via video rather than text. I don't think this will ever kill off text conversations on the internet (reddit is going strong, and I think anyone who fully engages in a video sharing platform vs text will eventually come to understand that a video platform will _always_ require much more work than text --- just because there's never going to be a way to make video editing as easy as text, mostly, you are just always going to have to do multiple takes of video if you want the quality to be reasonably high. But the power of video content is real, and the more people who consume it, the more people are going to want to make it. I'm wayyyy behind on understanding this.  
% Page 69: He talks about how can force costs (externalities) onto middlemen: for example making ports liable for stopping counterfeit handbags from entering the country might not cost the handbag manufacturers anything, but would cost the ports billions. Though it often costs everyone else a lot more to externalize costs, since the government often ends up footing the bill (pollution) or it's just inefficient (the best place to stop pollution is at the source).  
    % When I read this it's obvious that this is exactly Trump's low-grade "business" acumen at work: he thinks if the country is a business, then he can apply his Business 101 thinking and force other countries to pay America's expenses. This, of course, fundamentally misunderstands not only the cost of externalities, but the basic functions of governments in the world: governments are the backstop that picks up business externalities costs to generate wealth, not generators of wealth themselves. That might be fucked up and one of the main critiques of capitalism, but it is core to capitalism working!

% From article:  
    % While employees at big Chinese technology companies are limited to collaborating with colleagues, “if you work on open source, you work with talent around the world,”  
    % Many executives and pundits have argued that the big U.S. companies should not open source their technologies because they could be used to spread disinformation or cause other serious harm. Some U.S. lawmakers have explored the possibility of preventing or throttling the practice.  
    % But if the best open source technologies come from China, they argue, U.S. developers will build their systems atop those technologies. In the long-run, that could put China at the heart of A.I. research and development.  
    % Hours after his inauguration, President Trump rescinded a Biden administration executive order that threatened to curb open source technologies.
