  comment={Stephen King tells a memoir about developing as a writer, then gives his tips on writing. The first 100 pages are his memoir about growing into being a writer. Then he has a 'toolbox' for writers.},  
  category={The Art, writing}  
}  
% The first foreword is the most interesting part. In it he says that he asked Amy Tan what question he wished people would ask at Q&As. And she says "nobody ever asks about the language." It's the thing that set him thinking he should write about writing. He had his doubts because, as he says: Colonel Sanders sold a lot of chicken, but nobody really wants to know how he made it. And they ask the DeLillos and Updikes about language, but not popular authors.  
% (Actually, I'm sure there's lots of people who would like to ask Stephen King and Amy Tan about language -- but those people are probably vastly outnumbered at Q+As with those authors by idiots. Such is the burden of the popular author.)  
% The memoirs are well written, of course, but I skimmed it because it's not that interesting. The usual stuff about rejections and his own doubts, and encouragements by other people, and being a drunk. You could just guess it all, if you wanted to.  
% His 'toolbox' is mostly a recapping of Strunk and White. See comments in my notes on writing.  
% And the 'writing' section is a recap of all the advice you've ever heard before: the paragraph is the unit of composition; cut anything that doesn't move the story forward even if it's good (kill your babies); you can't be a good writer if you aren't a good reader; dialog is a gift for people with an ear for it, always make story the boss, never do character studies, Etc.  
% It would be exciting to get _one_ piece of advice from King that isn't a rehash of stuff you've heard a hundred times. Surprise me man! Give me a little nugget or secret to your wild success that isn't somethig I can learn elsewhere. 
% Still, this book is _good_, despite the fact that it's all rehash of the same old advice, it's _way_ more accessible than most other sources of those advice. For those who don't have the internal energy to push through Strunk and White (short as it is) this book gives you the same stuff in a much breezier and quick-reading way.  
% Page 189: nobody is the 'best friend' or the bad guy in real life. Write all your characters as if they are the central voice in their lives, because that's how real people are.  
% Page 191: On The Dead Zone: Making the presidential candidate the bad guy "called for a dangerously unstable politician... a fellow who could climb the political ladder by showing the world a jolly, jes'-folks face and charming the voters by refusing to play the game in the usual way." King goes on to see similarities in his main antagonist with Jesse Ventura's running for governor of Minnesota, and then dismisses that comparison because Ventura didn't want to start WWIII like his antagonist. So: King wrote a book about a present dude realizing the president is a madman, 30 years before the president was a madman by exactly the same mechanism as in his book!
	% This also tips King's hand to the weakness of his writing: wouldn't Dead Zone have been a much more interesting story if the character found out the presidential candidate was planning to start WWIII by some means other than magic? I never read the book, but his description of it makes the prescience idea sound extremely unsatisfying and unnecessary. I have no memory of the presidential assassination plot in the movie version. Maybe they dropped it because it was dumb? What I remember from the movie is the ability to foresee the deaths or horrible -- but every day -- things that might happen when the protagonist touches people (or maybe I'm mostly remembering the SNL sketch). Prescience of everyday horror is way more interesting than prescience of global consequence. Global consequence should be rooted out by either an everyday person who just happens to be in the right place at the right time (think Pentagon Papers or Snowden), or by some brilliant character who disentangles a complex web to reveal the truth. THIS is basic storytelling, and it just shocks me that King is so blind to his shortcomings around this kind of thing. I like the dude himself, and his advice on writing, and some elements of his books, but most of the ones I have read (at least the stories with supernatural elements) suffer from this kind of ham-handed handling of the supernatural. I do not understand how he made his name by that means.

% Not discussed: that for every one of these desperate internet searches, there must be dozens that never rise to the attention of the internet. There is still SO MUCH that is NOT on the internet. SO MUCh that would require this amount of work by all these people to earn a spot on the internet consciousness.  
% There's much more here than what the article is about. Really, it is about cultural consciousness. So much more has slipped from the cultural consciousness than remains in it.  
% There's different categories: There's things actively in the cultural consciousness.  
% There's stuff that is rememberd by many if mentioned, but not actively discussed (Roots)  
% There's stuff that is remembered by few or very few, and those few are online enough to identify a query by someone else (This cartoon).  
% There' stuff that is remembered by very few, but NOT identifiable by anyone online (older stuff, this cartoon until it WAS identified).  
% There's stuff that's not remembered by anyone, but exists in a record somewhere.  
% There's stuff that's not remembered and not recorded anywhere. (Likely the biggest category).  
% And these categories are JUST things I would call "cultural consiousness" materials --- things that MANY people shared at some point. There's also so MUCH MORE that's within personal or family/friend group consciousness only.  
% And there's also a distinction between stuff that only makes it to a level of consciousness among a small group of fanatics (say, Laibach) and stuff that is common household knowledge. And there's CURRENT and ACTIVE common household culture (Lord of the Rings), and forgotten household culture (All in the Family).

  Title={A Scrappier Model for Netflix Might Be More Sustainable},  
  journal={The New York Times},  
  date={2022-04-22},  
  comment={An interesting insight into the economics of movie-making. Streaming services (read: Netflix) pay high wages up front to people who create and work in television and movies so they can wholly own the final product and not have to share any details about the success for failure of geetting people to watch the thing with the creators. This is extremely expensive and removes much if not all of the economic motivation to create a commercially successful movie. Traditional movie-making models paid out to  creators from an obscure and hard-to-follow 'percentage points' system which preserves the motivation for commercial success, but resulted in a lot of legal wrangling over the complexity of the system. Blum argues that his method: where actors and creators are paid a straight share of box-office receipts but get paid the union minimum for their initial product -- creates a motivation for the creator to make a commercial successful product because they will make a lot of money off it from box office receipts, and the result will be more movies that are better commerially and artistically. He argues streaming services need to move to a model like this.},  
  category={The Art, Economics, film, tv, movies, movie production}  
}  
% It's interesting that he feels like creators need an economic motive to create a commercially successful work, but the _artistic_ motive will be inherent and does not require any economic motive. It is not unheard of for movie financers to WANT artistic quality, though unusual for sure, and maybe not great business.  
% He also warns about the creator who wants up-front payout without having made a hit already in lieu of a later payout at the box office. But he doesn't warn about the creator who might be willing to forego commercial success ENTIRELY in favor of an artistic piece.

% Page 1098: The Road Not Taken was actually intended as a joke for Robert Frost's friend Edward Thomas. Thomas could never make up his mind about anything, and Frost teased him by saying, "No matter which road you take, you'll always sigh and wish you'd taken another." Frost sent the poem to Thomas in a letter, but his friend missed the joke entirely, thining it was a poem about decisions Frost had made in his own life. According to bographer Lawrence Thompson, Frost could never bring himself to confess that the poem had not worked as he had intended.

  comment={* Tim Robinson made amazing hand-drawn maps of the areas around Galway. He then sort-of annotated those maps with these essays. * The A Connemara Fractal essay functions as a correction to a claim in his earlier essay Setting Foot on the Shores of Connemara that the coastline of a certain section might be more than 250 miles long if measured along all its intricate curves. However, he discovers that in fact the coastline is fractal in nature, and thus measuring a coastline that way essentially yields a measurement of infinity. So this essay starts from this very practical space and expands into a very accessible discussion of the what and _why_ of fractals (I've never really seen a "why" explanation of fractals before). He discovers that the coastline is neither 1 nor two dimensional, but is closer to something like 1.2 dimensions, (or 1 and a half if you go by Mandelbrot's original estimation.) This essay also veers off into a discussion of how stories (particularly of local spoken word tradition) are attached to the landscape, with a story of a town named for a large rock of quartz (put their by ancients) that looks like a horse grazing in a field. (This concept is akin to the way Adam Curtis talks about communities need to be in touch with their stories in that talk with Alan Moore.) He covers Patrick Pearce's fiction stories and how they reflect the landscape and the mythology of a free Ireland. * Place/Person/Book is about John Millington Synge who visited the Aran Islands at the turn of the 20th Century and wrote plays about the people there that were put on in London and Paris. * Listening to the Landscape draws out the significance of place names --- that they are bound up in this part of the world with the geology of the landscape and the stories the folks tell. It is, in fact, impossible to even understand Irish place names without going to look at the geology of the place and hearing the stories (again: Adam Curtis) that people tell about the place. * The final essay is called "Through Prehistoric Eyes" which argues that the placement of some boulders by Bronze Age inhabitants of the part of Ireland around Galway not only aligned with the sun setting between two mountains, but shows an aesthetic choice that transcends time, religion, and culture. He argues that the boulders could have been put anywhere along the line of the setting sun, but they chose the _only_ part of the landscape that _anyone_ would chose, because it aesthetically feels right. It is, essentially, the argument for the core of Modernism in art.},  
  category={The Art, bronze age, ireland, modernism}  
}  
% Not just an argument for modernism, but perhaps the MOST convincing argument that there is some kind of univeral aesthetics inherent to humans that I have ever read.  
% Those shared aesthetics would be deep down and fundamental, (and easily confused with making broad generalities that are really more about culture than not - say that classical music has universal appeal) but they may in fact be there, in the way that these peopel 4000 years ago chose the same site that any of us doing the same activity today would have chosen.  
% Is there something about the move that they were making - a change to the _landscape_ - that could become a universal aesthetic gesture?  
% Or that within the cultural requirement they had (that we don't understand why) of marking the line of the setting sun, that they were THEN (with that rule applied) put into a position of making an aesthetic choice, and it was at that moment, within those constraints of their culture, that they made a more fundamental universal choice for aesthetics?  
% page 51 -- he references the hag predicting a loss in battle to the marching O'Briens:  
"Quietly the broad-sworded warriors [of clan-Brian-Rua], many in number, in closest order, came hard by loch Rask; all together they looked on the shining mere, and there they saw the monstrous and distorted form of a lone ancient hideous hag that stooped over the bright loch's shore. The loathly creature's semblance was this: she was thatched with elf-locks foxy-grey and rough as heather, long as sea-wrack, inextricably tangled; had a bossy wrinkled foully ulcerated forehead; every hair of her eyebrows was like a strong fish-hook and, from under them, bleary dripping eyes peered with malignant fire between lids all rawly crimson-edged; she had a great blueish nose, flattened and wide, copiously and snortingly catarrhous; lips livid, white-rimmed, pustulous, that outwards turned up to her snout, and downwards to a stubby beard...  The crone had a cairn of heads, a pile of arms and legs, a load, of spoils, all which she rinsed and diligently washed, so that by her labour the water in its whole extension was covered with hair and gory brains."

Page 186: "Tailoring, I am told, was the easiest trade to take up in the old days, for all you needed was scissors, tame-measure and thimble. Tailors were often despised as being unfit for hard physical work." (Related to Xala's observation that sewing is extremely skilled, and extremely underpaid work.)
Page 187: "A peculiarity of these old songs is that, to make any sense of them, one has to know circumstances of their composition not explicit in the song itself; the song is the kernel of a nut, the shell of which is a dense fabric of personal histories and place-names -- not always the most digestible of stuff, but without it the kernel loses its savour." (This is, of course, true of ALL songs not just old Irish ones.)

But the article points out that the reality now is that there are no norms. ``“House of Cards” isn’t less crazy than reality. But it assumes a greater baseline of normalcy in its larger world.''

Stein and Larry Miller’s Blueprint for Counter Education is one of the defining (but neglected) works of radical pedagogy of the Vietnam War era. Originally published as a boxed set by Doubleday in 1970, the book was accompanied by large graphic posters that could serve as a portable learning environment for a new process-based model of education, and a bibliography and checklist that map patterns and relationships between radical thought and artistic practices—from the modernist avant-gardes to postmodernism, from the Bauhaus to Black Mountain College, from Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin to Buckminster Fuller and Norman O. Brown—with Herbert Marcuse and Marshall McLuhan serving as points of anchorage. Blueprint for Counter Education thus serves as a vital synthesis of the numerous intellectual currents in the countercultural debate on the radical reform of schools, universities and ways of learning. To accompany this new facsimile edition of the book and posters, an 80-page booklet features a conversation with the original Blueprint creators, Maurice R. Stein, Larry Miller and designer Marshall Henrichs, as well as essays from Jeffrey Schnapp, Paul Cronin and notes on the design by Adam Michaels of Project Projects.''

Includes the notion that forgeries rely on current notions of things: ``Superior forgeries typically secrete subliminally up-to-the-minute associations, which pass, at first blush, as signs of “timeless” genius.

Here, we use a Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model of geographic profiling, a mathematical technique developed in criminology and finding increasing application within ecology and epidemiology, to analyse the spatial patterns of Banksy artworks in Bristol and London. The model takes as input the locations of these artworks, and calculates the probability of ‘offender’ residence across the study area. Our analysis highlights areas associated with one prominent candidate (e.g., his home), supporting his identification as Banksy. More broadly, these results support previous suggestions that analysis of minor terrorism-related acts (e.g., graffiti) could be used to help locate terrorist bases before more serious incidents occur, and provides a fascinating example of the application of the model to a complex, real-world problem. },

% Besides that he references the 1997 Times article saying the cost of the average film has gone up to $60 million, and how ridiculous that seems now.

They are joined by a band of older women called the Vuvalini, who along with Furiosa, decide to give Immortan Joe’s patriarchy a taste of its own medicine.''},

% This is an excellent essay. Though I don't agree with the negative conclusion. So the iconoclasts have been successful at smashing everything. So what? How is that worse than art being exclusively a hobby for the wealthy? Why does he assume that an ancient Egyptian masterpiece _is_ more valuable than a 1960s industrial design piece? Maybe we have simply wiped the slate clean and now we are simply awaiting something better. It's amazing that this essay could be written without reference to Laibach though.

"We’re seeing the underlying systems become more complex and automated to the point where very few people understand how they work, but at the same time we want these invisible public-facing interfaces," he told me via email. "The result is a growing gulf between the mental model (how the person thinks the thing works) and the system model (how it actually works). A bigger gulf means bigger tensions, and more and more situations where deception is used to resolve these gaps."''},
