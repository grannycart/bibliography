Art drops off the list among those aged under 70, with sports, technology and philanthropy the most popular interests among the under-50s.''

Haubegger also said the perception that such films are risky means they face more studio scrutiny from the outset.''},

  publisher={Lilliput Press},  
  comment={* Tim Robinson made amazing hand-drawn maps of the areas around Galway. He then sort-of annotated those maps with these essays. * The A Connemara Fractal essay functions as a correction to a claim in his earlier essay Setting Foot on the Shores of Connemara that the coastline of a certain section might be more than 250 miles long if measured along all its intricate curves. However, he discovers that in fact the coastline is fractal in nature, and thus measuring a coastline that way essentially yields a measurement of infinity. So this essay starts from this very practical space and expands into a very accessible discussion of the what and _why_ of fractals (I've never really seen a "why" explanation of fractals before). He discovers that the coastline is neither 1 nor two dimensional, but is closer to something like 1.2 dimensions, (or 1 and a half if you go by Mandelbrot's original estimation.) This essay also veers off into a discussion of how stories (particularly of local spoken word tradition) are attached to the landscape, with a story of a town named for a large rock of quartz (put their by ancients) that looks like a horse grazing in a field. (This concept is akin to the way Adam Curtis talks about communities need to be in touch with their stories in that talk with Alan Moore.) He covers Patrick Pearce's fiction stories and how they reflect the landscape and the mythology of a free Ireland. * Place/Person/Book is about John Millington Synge who visited the Aran Islands at the turn of the 20th Century and wrote plays about the people there that were put on in London and Paris. * Listening to the Landscape draws out the significance of place names --- that they are bound up in this part of the world with the geology of the landscape and the stories the folks tell. It is, in fact, impossible to even understand Irish place names without going to look at the geology of the place and hearing the stories (again: Adam Curtis) that people tell about the place. * The final essay is called "Through Prehistoric Eyes" which argues that the placement of some boulders by Bronze Age inhabitants of the part of Ireland around Galway not only aligned with the sun setting between two mountains, but shows an aesthetic choice that transcends time, religion, and culture. He argues that the boulders could have been put anywhere along the line of the setting sun, but they chose the _only_ part of the landscape that _anyone_ would chose, because it aesthetically feels right. It is, essentially, the argument for the core of Modernism in art.},  
  category={The Art, bronze age, ireland, modernism}  
}  
% Not just an argument for modernism, but perhaps the MOST convincing argument that there is some kind of univeral aesthetics inherent to humans that I have ever read.  
% Those shared aesthetics would be deep down and fundamental, (and easily confused with making broad generalities that are really more about culture than not - say that classical music has universal appeal) but they may in fact be there, in the way that these peopel 4000 years ago chose the same site that any of us doing the same activity today would have chosen.  
% Is there something about the move that they were making - a change to the _landscape_ - that could become a universal aesthetic gesture?  
% Or that within the cultural requirement they had (that we don't understand why) of marking the line of the setting sun, that they were THEN (with that rule applied) put into a position of making an aesthetic choice, and it was at that moment, within those constraints of their culture, that they made a more fundamental universal choice for aesthetics?  
% page 51 -- he references the hag predicting a loss in battle to the marching O'Briens:  
"Quietly the broad-sworded warriors [of clan-Brian-Rua], many in number, in closest order, came hard by loch Rask; all together they looked on the shining mere, and there they saw the monstrous and distorted form of a lone ancient hideous hag that stooped over the bright loch's shore. The loathly creature's semblance was this: she was thatched with elf-locks foxy-grey and rough as heather, long as sea-wrack, inextricably tangled; had a bossy wrinkled foully ulcerated forehead; every hair of her eyebrows was like a strong fish-hook and, from under them, bleary dripping eyes peered with malignant fire between lids all rawly crimson-edged; she had a great blueish nose, flattened and wide, copiously and snortingly catarrhous; lips livid, white-rimmed, pustulous, that outwards turned up to her snout, and downwards to a stubby beard...  The crone had a cairn of heads, a pile of arms and legs, a load, of spoils, all which she rinsed and diligently washed, so that by her labour the water in its whole extension was covered with hair and gory brains."

Filth and grime were removed and it was restored from a dark interior to gleaming white, as it was thought to be when new. Its famous black Madonna, that had been painted white at some point, has been restored to black. The problem is, not everyone thinks it's such a great thing. Visitors think it is arrogant. Some people argue that the restoration makes the cathedral look fake and new. Others argue that is what it was _intended_ to look like, and there's no reason to get romantic or nostalgic about dirt. The black Madonna was commissioned as a copy of a white earlier one.},

  comment={Reprint of the book originally released by Doubleday in 1970. ``Maurice R. Stein and Larry Miller’s Blueprint for Counter Education is one of the defining (but neglected) works of radical pedagogy of the Vietnam War era. Originally published as a boxed set by Doubleday in 1970, the book was accompanied by large graphic posters that could serve as a portable learning environment for a new process-based model of education, and a bibliography and checklist that map patterns and relationships between radical thought and artistic practices—from the modernist avant-gardes to postmodernism, from the Bauhaus to Black Mountain College, from Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin to Buckminster Fuller and Norman O. Brown—with Herbert Marcuse and Marshall McLuhan serving as points of anchorage. Blueprint for Counter Education thus serves as a vital synthesis of the numerous intellectual currents in the countercultural debate on the radical reform of schools, universities and ways of learning. To accompany this new facsimile edition of the book and posters, an 80-page booklet features a conversation with the original Blueprint creators, Maurice R. Stein, Larry Miller and designer Marshall Henrichs, as well as essays from Jeffrey Schnapp, Paul Cronin and notes on the design by Adam Michaels of Project Projects.''

  comment = {New Yorker review of two books about Han van Meegeren, which both tell the story of the greatest art forger of all time, who forged Vermeers at a time an in such a way as to fool all the contemporary experts and the Nazis. But the books also show that he was undeserving of his reputation as a Dutch national hero, and that his painting live painting to prove his innocence and that he was the forger was in fact a publicity stunt. Includes the notion that forgeries rely on current notions of things: ``Superior forgeries typically secrete subliminally up-to-the-minute associations, which pass, at first blush, as signs of “timeless” genius. The art historian Max Friedländer, who said, “Forgeries must be served hot,” promulgated a forty-year rule—four decades or so being how long it takes for the modern nuances of a forgery to date themselves as clichés of the period in which they were painted.''},  
  category = {Art & Film, forgery, fakes, painting, nazis, vermeer, han van meegeren}  
}  
% Also see the wikipedia entry on van Meegeren: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_van_Meegeren} which tells the more traditional story about how he fooled everyone including the nazis, and eventually his OWN works started to be faked. And that Jesus Among the Doctors (the painting painted to "prove his innocence/guilt" now hangs in a Johannesburg church --- which at least suggests that his work is good enough to do the actual work Vermeer would have created paintings for: to praise the glory of God.)  
% Also see this op-ed in the Times which argues to appreciate forgeries; that the genius of artists is more often the _idea_ than it is the execution. \url{http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/opinion/sunday/in-praise-of-art-forgeries.html} This op-ed also brings up how forgeries CONTINUE to fool experts regularly. It's not like lessons were learned from van Meegeren. Also points out that forgers help break down the insanity of the art market by devaluing the insanely overvalued art.

Here, we use a Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model of geographic profiling, a mathematical technique developed in criminology and finding increasing application within ecology and epidemiology, to analyse the spatial patterns of Banksy artworks in Bristol and London. The model takes as input the locations of these artworks, and calculates the probability of ‘offender’ residence across the study area. Our analysis highlights areas associated with one prominent candidate (e.g., his home), supporting his identification as Banksy. More broadly, these results support previous suggestions that analysis of minor terrorism-related acts (e.g., graffiti) could be used to help locate terrorist bases before more serious incidents occur, and provides a fascinating example of the application of the model to a complex, real-world problem. },

% There's some interesting stuff in this article, but the fundamental argument that this is BAD for film doesn't totally follow. It shows how its GOOD for TV. So if the fortunes of the moderately well-off filmmmakers eventually turn back their way (which seems likely to me, that's a market biding its time, not under permanent collapse) will this guy write the same article about the corresponding loss in quality of television?  
% Besides that he references the 1997 Times article saying the cost of the average film has gone up to $60 million, and how ridiculous that seems now. But in adjusted dollars that's like $84 million, so it's not that big a jump. The biggest jump in film cost actually came in the early 1990s, but he doesn't address that.
