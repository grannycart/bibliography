  journal={The New York Times},  
  date={2020-07-08},  
  comment={New DNA evidence suggests that people from South America were present in the Polynesian islands before Europeans arrived in the middle of the millennium. This suggests that either ancient Polynesians made their way to South America and brought some people back to the Pacific islands with them, or South American Native Americans made their way (or lost their way) to the Pacific Islands. This COULD support the Thor Heyerdahl theory in Kon-Tiki that South Americans ventured out onto the Pacific and made their way to the central Pacific. Others think that idea is outmoded and old-fashioned, and Polynesians (with their double-hulled canoes) were simply so good at crossing seas that they easily made it to South America and back. It's also possible the DNA evidence simply isn't totally conclusive.},

Includes Stamets heuristic for identifying them: If a gilled mushroom has purplish brown to black spores, and the flesh bruises bluish, the mushroom in question is very likely a psilocybin-producing species. Tells how to do a spore print: lay the cap on a white piece of paper (if the spores are dark-colored) and let sit for a few hours under a glass (to preserve moisture). Works best with fresh mushrooms. Also covers some of the history of psychedelic mushrooms - mostly in mesoamerica and how that history was repressed by white invaders. Describes the habitat of the mushrooms: they grow on dead plant matter and like disturbed habitats like landslides or eroded places - this means they have benefited greatly from human civilization because humans bring habitat disruption with them everywhere, particularly with civilization. Stamets attributes this to a kind of intelligence on the part of the mushrooms. The forword by Andrew Weil includes a paragraph about the uncanniness of how these mushrooms evolved this chemical that affects humans so profoundly, and how this suggests a much deeper complexity to the universe than is commonly understood (read: magic).},

% My under-informed crackpot theory is that ancient humans are _responsible_ for the evolution of these mushrooms.

% This is mostly supported by the fact that there's a lot of mushrooms growing in regions populated early by humans (if you look at a map) like Africa, and across Russia.

The unique thing is the author admits, in some case, to enjoying sex with her father. ``As much as The Incest Diary is a book about pain, it is undeniably also a book about pleasure. The author lusted and lusts still after her father. She is furious when she comes to realize that he also has sex with her mother. When she is eight years old and they move to a new house, she assumes that she will share the master bedroom with him. After her parents divorce two years later, she begins leading her father into his room for sex. Even once the abuse is over, she cannot have an orgasm without seeing her father’s face, “as if my ultimate erotic experience is being raped by the man who created me.” A few times a year, she has a dream in which it is just her and her father, alone in the world, fucking “all we want.” “My father is my secret,” she writes. “But the secret under the secret is that sometimes I liked it. Sometimes I wanted it, and sometimes I seduced him and made him fuck me.'' The reviewer points out that this suggests that consent (or lack of it) is not enough to recognize victims of sexual violence. ``'This is why the question of whether or not a child “wants it” is irrelevant to the morality of pedophilia: not because children don’t want it — or do want it — but because “wanting it” is itself something so easily formed by adult violence. And not just the declaration of the wanting — what is a child’s “let’s fuck” but a simulacrum of consent? — but the wanting itself. When a victim of sexual abuse says she wanted it, she is telling us about the sort of person the abuse required her to be. '},

  comment={``The benefits of nonsexual touch read like a 19th-century tonic advertisement, except that the outcomes have been scientifically vetted. Touch has been found, among other things, to reduce stress, heart rate and blood pressure. Touch has even been found to lower the level of cortisol in the body (especially in women) which, when elevated, impedes our working memory and, most critically, the immune system’s resiliency. It should be great news that something free, widely available and lacking in harmful side effects is so good for us, but it gets ignored in a touch-averse culture like ours.'' Discusses how men handle stress more poorly than women, by growing stoic or "cowboy" in the face of stress. Women get higher levels of oxytocin when stressed which enhances their ability to cope. But both men and women get higher oxytocin levels through affectionate touch. This "gender role stress" doesn't make men more resilient, it makes then more vulnerable to anxiety and depression, and prevents them from feeling like they should seek mental help. Thus they develop more stress-related disorders like hypertension, alcohol, and drug abuse.},

While elevated it is not a risk at all that would preclude those couples from having children. This is not to be confused with incest --- sex between siblings or parents --- which is thought to have a much higher risk of genetic disease. (Though apparently as of this article in 2002 it sounds like nobody had actually studied that.) The risk to first cousins is far less than the risk of some parents who simply have a genetic disease, and ethically those people are not told they shouldn't have children. In other cultures it is considered preferable to marry a first cousin. The US has some kind of hangup, possibly beause of the eugenics movement which flourished in the US in the first part of the 20th century. Many states (as of 2002) have laws against marrying first cousins, and people are told by local doctors they shouldn't have children, but those doctors are misinformed.},

Right- and left-handers have coexisted at least since the Upper Palaeolithic, and left-handers are in the minority in all human populations. The persistence of the polymorphism of handedness is a puzzle because this trait is substantially heritable and several fitness costs are associated with left-handedness. Some countervailing benefit is required to maintain the polymorphism. Left-handers may have a frequency-dependent advantage in fights--the advantage being greater when their frequency is lower. Sports data from Western societies are consistent with this prediction. Here, we show that the frequency of left-handers is strongly and positively correlated with the rate of homicides across traditional societies. It ranges from 3\% in the most pacifistic societies, to 27\% in the most violent and warlike. This finding is consistent with a frequency-dependent selection mechanism maintaining left-handedness in these societies.},

Instead humans resisted for thousands of years the drag into civilization because the hunter gatherer life was so much better. Jared Diamond calls the move to agriculture the worst mistake in human history. Agriculture rose with cereal grains specifically because they were easy to tax, while other foods like breadfruit or plantain were not. Taxation led to writing, to keep lists of who has paid, and writing and cereals led to an elite ruling class, and thus civilization --- at the cost of slave labor and a decreased quality of life for most people.},

% On fire: In “Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States,” James C. Scott, a professor of political science at Yale, presents a plausible contender for the most important piece of technology in the history of man. It is a technology so old that it predates Homo sapiens and instead should be credited to our ancestor Homo erectus. That technology is fire. We have used it in two crucial, defining ways. The first and the most obvious of these is cooking. As Richard Wrangham has argued in his book “Catching Fire,” our ability to cook allows us to extract more energy from the food we eat, and also to eat a far wider range of foods. Our closest animal relative, the chimpanzee, has a colon three times as large as ours, because its diet of raw food is so much harder to digest. The extra caloric value we get from cooked food allowed us to develop our big brains, which absorb roughly a fifth of the energy we consume, as opposed to less than a tenth for most mammals’ brains. That difference is what has made us the dominant species on the planet.  
% The other reason fire was central to our history is less obvious to contemporary eyes: we used it to adapt the landscape around us to our purposes. Hunter-gatherers would set fires as they moved, to clear terrain and make it ready for fast-growing, prey-attracting new plants. They would also drive animals with fire. They used this technology so much that, Scott thinks, we should date the human-dominated phase of earth, the so-called Anthropocene, from the time our forebears mastered this new tool.  
% We don’t give the technology of fire enough credit, Scott suggests, because we don’t give our ancestors much credit for their ingenuity over the long period—ninety-five per cent of human history—during which most of our species were hunter-gatherers. “Why human fire as landscape architecture doesn’t register as it ought to in our historical accounts is perhaps that its effects were spread over hundreds of millennia and were accomplished by ‘precivilized’ peoples also known as ‘savages,’ ” Scott writes. To demonstrate the significance of fire, he points to what we’ve found in certain caves in southern Africa. The earliest, oldest strata of the caves contain whole skeletons of carnivores and many chewed-up bone fragments of the things they were eating, including us. Then comes the layer from when we discovered fire, and ownership of the caves switches: the human skeletons are whole, and the carnivores are bone fragments. Fire is the difference between eating lunch and being lunch.

  comment={Argues that we need to develop a culture of ethical questioning of the decision to have children. Similar to the way we decide whether to buy a house or not. At the moment, the burden is on people who choose NOT to have children to explain themselves. ``In fact, people are still expected to provide reasons not to have children, but no reasons are required to have them. It’s assumed that if individuals do not have children it is because they are infertile, too selfish or have just not yet gotten around to it. In any case, they owe their interlocutor an explanation. On the other hand, no one says to the proud parents of a newborn, Why did you choose to have that child? What are your reasons? The choice to procreate is not regarded as needing any thought or justification.'' ``Such a question also profoundly affects the well-being of existing people (the potential parents, siblings if any, and grandparents). And it has effects beyond the family on the broader society, which is inevitably changed by the cumulative impact — on things like education, health care, employment, agriculture, community growth and design, and the availability and distribution of resources — of individual decisions about whether to procreate.'' ``Perhaps people fail to see childbearing as an ethical choice because they think of it as the expression of an instinct or biological drive, like sexual attraction or “falling in love,” that is not amenable to ethical evaluation. But whatever our biological inclinations may be, many human beings do take control over their fertility, thanks to contemporary means of contraception and abortion.'' ``My aim, I hasten to add, is not to argue for policing people’s procreative motives. I am simply arguing for the need to think systematically and deeply about a fundamental aspect of human life.  The burden of proof — or at least the burden of justification — should therefore rest primarily on those who choose to have children, not on those who choose to be childless.'' ``Because children are dependent, needy and vulnerable, prospective parents should consider how well they can love and care for the offspring they create, and the kind of relationship they can have with them. The genuinely unselfish life plan may at least sometimes be the choice not to have children, especially in the case of individuals who would otherwise procreate merely to adhere to tradition, to please others, to conform to gender conventions, or to benefit themselves out of the inappropriate expectation that children will fix their problems. Children are neither human pets nor little therapists.''},

It gets confusing: The federal government, partly at the behest of an underhanded corporation, sabotaged a community of hardworking and benevolent utopians — but only to create something fundamentally idealistic and to protect an irreplaceable ecological wonder from capitalistic loggers. And yet, the loggers were the utopians. The capitalists were socialists! Which would have been fine, except that the government had mistaken them for an underhanded corporation. Baffled, I called William Tweed, the retired Sequoia park ranger, who has also written about the colony. “You reach a stage in life where what you most frequently see in history is irony,” Tweed told me sagely. “Perhaps the lesson for 2017 is that ideology rarely explains what happens.”'' },

% At first I was thinking: how could people who have been breeding animals for thousands of years not realize that natural selection was going on.  
% Darwin actually answers this question: breeders up to the 19th century always thought they were making choices to mix breeds that were separately decsended from wile breeds. Unconsciously the selected the most fit animasls from their stock for breeding, but with most animals it was difficult to see change to the breed within a human lifetime.  
% What this suggests most to me is how deeply ingrained in our thinking natural selection is now in a post-darwin world that I just assumed breeders should have realized this.  
% Another interesing thing is that Darwin is careful to cite influences and sources. He makes it very clear that he is the person who best articulated a theory that had been boiling for some time. It is not at all that he just popped this thing out of his head, he just put all the pieces together. The theory evolved.  
% In arguing that there is no difference between what 19th century scientists were call "species" and "varieties" he points out that while most of the scientists were focussing on the similarties of animals, chunking them together into "species" he wanted to focus on the small differences that set them apart - for those small differences are the things that he believed led to new species. Page 45  
% This is interesting: it suggests that paying attention to the details, not being lured in by the larger themes that may already exist in the general thought of the culture you are in, may lead you to a whole new set of larger themes.  
% 19th century science is a really different thing: it still has elements of statistics, but it's really about _observation_. While modern science is essentially nothing but statistics.  
% I think we still try to sell kids on the idea that science is observation - "experiments" are bubbling beakers or setting various things on fire to see what would happen, or disecting things to see how they work. This is a very 19th century version of science and has little (though not completely nothing) to do with the statistics and math based science of modern times that is actually fairly dull in everyday practice.  
% He refers to shipwrecked sailors near shore - how it's better for strong swimmers to be stronger, and for weak swimmers to be weaker (and so stay with the wreck). ~Page 105  
% He talks about how it is known among domestic animals that they vary purely in reaction to climate: like dogs growing a thicker coat in the cold. But he thinks that is a small effect compared to natural variation responding to climate.  
% Darwin says that science can't be responsive to vox populi vox dei. He gives the example that science had to recognize that the earth revolves around the sun, not the other way around, even if popular opinion was otherwise.  
% A thing that comes up over and over again with Darwin is the SCALE of time required for natural selection (he never says "evolution") to take place. This is another area where part of our blindness to this theory is the difficulty of humans to deal with the sheer scale of geological time scales.  
% Reading Darwin in the light of Patrick O'Brian really makes you think about disection. Darwin often includes descriptions of viscera that border on gross.  
% Darwin doesn't really have much trouble with the eye. But the electric organs of fish, on the other hand, creates a real problem. Page 139  
% He says other authors have a view of nature "like a toy store" wity variety for varieties sake. Page 142. Though this does make one wonder if perhaps the variety IS there for the entertainment... of _someone_.  
% I start to wonder about the effect of inheritance, which D does mention briefly. Consider the fact that so many mammals have 5 bones in their "fingers" adapted in a billion ways. (See page 147.)  But why five? Obviously if growing a sixth finger helps a species, it will happen, but in most cases they just have 5 because that's what their ancestors had. And then those 5 evolve into wings or flippers or whatever, where essentially there is only 1 or 2 digits for functional purposes. Those digits might just as easily contained 3 or 8 bone structures. - see page 334 where he kind of picks this topic up.  
% Darwin points out that flowers are beautiful soley to catch the eye of the insect in a field of green. (Page 147)  
% Darwin says, "I may first remark that this sense of beauty obviously depends on the nature of the mind, irrespective of any real quality in the admired object; and that idea of what is beautiful, is not innate or unalterable. We see this, for instance, in the men of different races admiring an entirely differeny standard of beauty in their women." Page 147.  
% I do believe that biologists, when examining some funky part or behavior an animal evoled, almost immediately fall back on it being for obtaining food or sex.  
% I think this is an equivalent simplistic understanding of the world as the "rational actor" is of economics.  
% Think of play - it isn't for food or sex. But it allows the animal to develop it's brain, (which granted, might yield more food later). The behavior is directly for nothing more than fun. Periods of rest are similar. They have long-term benefits for food or sex, but the immediate benefit might be pleasure, social company, or entertainment. We KNOW animals get bored - think of pets left home alone. Why do biologists never think that might be part of an animals behavior in the wild? Or that animals might evolve structures that are part of their entertainment behavior?  
% See \url{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/parenting/animal-behavior-play-games.html}  
% There's also structures that remain from some use in the past, sometimes repurposed for other uses.  
% And there's simply individual preferences. A single individual might have ANY kind of bahvior (it would be part of the variation of natural selection). I think biologists DO understand that though.  
% Natural selection is a simple concept in stating that species develop useful characteristics to survive better than their competitors. It is complex because the rules of the competition are not always clear to humans with their short life-spans and limited fossil record. Particularly in the use of energy: a person might say: why didn't an animal evolve some kind of ranged weapon? or some other fantastical device. But there's two big reasons it didn't: one it had to come from something that already existed, and two there is not unlimited energy to power new structures. This is why disued structures tend to fade away too. One big factor often overlooked: how much energy is available to power the development of a new structure.  
% It's funny that humans have such a poor undersanding of energy consumption as a part of animal life. (See bike racing.) One would think that it would be an inherently instinctive thing. And maybe it is at some deep physical level. But we have not conscious recognition of it.  
% D says "the most serious special difficulty my theory has encountered" is the problem of neuter insects (not the eye). That is, worker ants who evolved special adaptations like extra armor or giant jaws, but are neuter and can't pass on their adaptation to offspring.  
% His conclusion (I assume rightly) is that the worker ants themselves could be seen as adaptations of the the fertile ants. This is possible among social animals (already you can see early hints at thinking of any colonies as a whole organism, not individuals). For social animals it is possible to have sterile workers who develop special adaptations because those sterile individuals help the fertile ones to flourish. He also includes here a funny example of degrees of variation by talking about construction workers who might be from 5 to 15 feet high, wich giant jaws and heads.  
% See page 205 and nearby pages in chapter on instincts.  
% The instincts chapter also includes some neat descriptions of the cuckoo's habit of laying eggs in other bird's next and pushing the other bird's young out of the nest. And also detailed descriptions of slave making ants.  
% He briefly mentions in the instinct chapter the ant habit of farming aphids. Even he calls the aphids "cattle". The fact that ants are carrying out agriculture is not missed by him.  
% (In this edition) Darwin mentions Archaeopteryx on page 251  
% Darwin struggles with the age of the earth. He is up against the current thinking that the Earth is relatively young (vs today's standards) thousands or millions of years old. Darwin tries to epmhasize how long a million years is. He says that huge amounts of time must have been necessary for natural seleciton to occur - he suggests many millions if not hundreds of millions of years. Little does he suspect that the scales he is talking about are far smaller than reality - BILLIONS of years.  
% This was written long before the theory of plate tectonics, and that causes Darwin some trouble trying to explain why different species are very similar in very different places. But he does suggest that maybe the oceans the continents have not always been where they are now. Page 276  
% Darwin proposed two be challenges to a species success that evolution has to overcome: the nature of the environment into a which a species moves, and other species against which it has to competete. At the time he was writing, a LOT of stock was put into being fit for a new environment. But Darwin argues that it is actually competition that matters most. He saw this in the Galapagos. P. 311  
% [Origin is a good example of how to "write the book" on something. The theory is broad and very generalized. The kind of thing you could come up with sitting around your sitting room. It fits well, and makes sense, but there are also lots of exceptions, some of which Darwin can't explain (in some cases because the science just wasn't there to support him yet - like plate tectonics and the age the Earth). Being broad and not always working doesn't matter though. What makes it convincing, is years and years of examples collected and applied. If one wanted to write a book that changes the whole way people see the world, with lasting impacts, this is a good model.]  
% There's some interesting comment on hair, beards, and skin color towards the end of Descent of Man.  
% "When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a long history; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, in the same way as any great mechanical invention is the summing up of the labor, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, I speak from experience, does the study of natural history become!" Page 371  
% Darwin's ideas of sexual selection were largely ignored until the 1980s, scientists assumes that natural selection actually accounted for sexual selection, in complicated ways - like bright feathers signaled a healthy immune system or something. Further research indicated that while this was sometimes true, more often sexual selection was happening for traits that couldn't really be explained as natural selection. Richard Prum put forth a theory in the 1980s that animals made choices that affect their evolution based on beauty, and that there is no way to understand why certain things would be regarded as beautiful by animals. More modern thinking is that sexual selection is driven by a number of mechanisms, not least that sometimes environment and perception of the enviornment shape what animals value and select for.

% ``one particular aspect of his argument is his distress at the idea that almost all evolutionary change is assumed to be adaptive, contributing to fitness. In other words, if a fish is blue, it must be blue for a reason. The color must help it escape predators or sneak up on prey, or be otherwise useful in some way. Beauty, therefore, must be adaptive, or a sign of underlying qualities that are adaptive. Pick a behavior or an ornament or a physical trait, and it is useful until proven otherwise. That’s backward, says Dr. Prum. Take beauty. Since animals have aesthetic preferences and make choices, beauty will inevitably appear. “Beauty happens,” as he puts it, and it should be taken as nonadaptive until proven otherwise.''

Interstingly points out that Stephen Jay Gould did his best to argue that there is no purpose to evolution. ``This is the best, the most interesting experiment they could set up: to set up the evolution on Planet Earth going in such a way that it would produce these really interesting characters — humans who go around doing things — and they watch their experiment, interfering hardly at all so that almost everything we do comes out according to the laws of nature. But every now and then they see something which doesn’t look quite right — this zoo is going to kill itself off if they let you do this or that.” So, he continued, these extraterrestrials “insert a finger and just change some little thing. And maybe those are the miracles which the religious people like to so emphasize.”'' },

% While I gnerally agree with this, there's a couple of problems:  
# 1 - this is a classic example of philosophers arguing/thinknig about stuff that is fundamentally unknowable. Who cares if higher forces are occasionally interveneing in our lives if there's no way to know if it's true or not? Just acknowledge the possibility and move on.  
% 2 - Who says the higher purpose is GOOD? To make the experiment "interesting" would mean keeping it from collapsing - potentially seen as a "good" - but also possibly stirring the pot: say by making Trump president.  
% We as humans really WANT our lives to be meaningful, to serve some "higher purpose" but while Gould might be wrong that evolution is completely random, maybe what he sees as "random" is actually a higher purpose that want both good and bad things to happen - because they, like us, would find only good things happening to be terrifically dull.

% She frames killing and dying as "work" and that killing demanded the "harder courage". Page 32  
% A lot of this book is about Civil War-era folks desparately trying to maintain their Christian beliefs in the face of the horrors of war. Particularly regarding the idea of "the good death" where the dying indicates in some way that they are surely going on to the after life.  
% Traditionally the good death would have happened at home, surrounded by friends and family who could see the dying as they passed on to the afterlife. The war forced many many men to die far from home, and so a lot of this book is taken up with various ways families resolved that: through the development of embalming and special caskets, accounts of last words on the battle fields, or even last letters from the dying. But sometimes this war in an era that was becoming industrial would just completely disintegrate some men. Many just disappeared entirely.  
% Spiritualism became huge during the war because of this - many cults and people believed they could talk to the dead. Mediums sprang up, one magazine even published regular messages from beyond the grave (for a very long time after the war ended too). The planchette was developed - an early version of the ouiji board - a parlor game which people could buy and play to communicate with the dead. Page 182  
% There's some interesting ideas mentioned in here (I've lost the page references) to the timeless fact that men felt most alive in battles, and that the will to go into battle is primarily derived from the sense of duty to the other men in their immediate circle of the war. This suggests interesting things about men in gangs in cities - it's potentially the same things that would have to be overcome - the sense that this is their MOST alive time of life, and commitment to their friends above all else - even family, country, religion.  
% She says that Paul Fussell says wars always beget irony because intentions are always overturned by circumstance. Wars outcome is always much more horrible than we can anticipate. Page 194.

% Latin and Greek. Oates was generally deep in Napier's History of the  
% Peninsular War, and some of us found Herbert Paul's History of Modern  
% England a great stand-by. Most of us managed to find room in our  
% personal gear when sledging for some book which did not weigh much and  
% yet would last. Scott took some Browning on the Polar Journey, though I  
% only saw him reading it once; Wilson took Maud and In Memoriam; Bowers  
% always had so many weights to tally and observations to record on  
% reaching camp that I feel sure he took no reading matter. Bleak House  
% was the most successful book I ever took away sledging, though a volume  
% of poetry was useful, because it gave one something to learn by heart  
% and repeat during the blank hours of the daily march, when the idle  
% mind is all too apt to think of food in times of hunger, or possibly  
% of purely imaginary grievances, which may become distorted into real  
% foundations of discord under the abnormal strain of living for months  
% in the unrelieved company of three other men. If your companions have  
% much the same tastes as yourself it is best to pool your allowance of  
% weights and take one book which will offer a wide field of thought and  
% discussion. I have heard Scott and Wilson bless the thought which led  
% them to take Darwin's Origin of Species on their first Southern Journey.  
% Such is the object of your sledging book, but you often want the book  
% which you read for half an hour before you go to sleep at Winter  
% Quarters to take you into the frivolous fripperies of modern social life  
% which you may not know and may never wish to know, but which it is often

% The idea of cannibalism (particularly in the south pacific) enters Western consciousness when Cook visits New Zealand, page 104    
% "Kangaroo" was long thought to be a misinterpretation by Cook and Banks of the word said by the aboriginals. Right into modern times it was told that "kangaroo" meant something like "what did you say?" But in fact Cook and Banks got a list of common words from the local aboriginals, and they were fairly accurate, including the term for the animal. Page, 124   
% On a later visit to New Zealand, during the second voyage, the Maori horrified the Europeans by eating the flesh of a young boy they had killed in battle. ...Then Cook and another crew member ask the Moari to do it again, (to prove for certain that they partake in cannibalism) and even slice off and cook the meat on the ship.  
% The book points out that while the Moari do sometimes eat the flesh of enemies killed in battle, it probably wasn't super common. Another aspect of the Moari culture is to do things that are intimidating or defy conventions for the pleasure of doing it. As in their haka war dance. It is very likely that they were eating the flesh FOR the Europeans, essentially to freak them out. Page 211  
% The OTHER ship on Cook's second voyage (not with Cook on board) was long separated from Cook.

(Elsewhere, it's explained that when seawater freezes, it precipitates out the salt, so melted seawater yields fresh water.) Since it was believed that ice in the north and south only came from nearby freshwater rivers, it was also believed that a Northwest Passage could exist. Cook's third voyage was sent out to find it.

When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, written language or the development among Eurasians of resistance to endemic diseases), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian genomes.''},

% I do also remember from this book that Diamond figures out that there are actually very few species of animal that COULD be domesticated world wide, and Europeans were lucky enough to have access to a bunch of them.

In the present book focusing on collapses rather than buildups, I compare many past and present societies that differed with respect to environmental fragility, relations with neighbors, political institutions, and other "input" variables postulated to influence a society's stability. The "output" variables that I examine are collapse or survival, and form of the collapse if collapse does occur. By relating output variables to input variables, I aim to tease out the influence of possible input variables on collapses.''},

% This idea is so solid that it's surprising that it hasn't been  
% explored previously in the hundreds of years since Darwin.  
% The one part that's weak is the chapter suggesting that the  
% differences between the work of the sexes arises because of the fires.  
% In most cultures throughout history human men go out and hunt and  
% women stay home and gather. But while Wrangham pins this division on  
% fire (men had more time to hunt while women cooked) you could see it  
% equally as being spurred by something else - say women were more  
% interested in gathering because it's a more reliable food source - and  
% they need to feed their babies (cooked or not) while men are willing  
% to starve a little for a tastier unreliable food source (cooked or  
% not). This also doesn't clearly carry well to the male-female partner  
% bonding that Wrangham claims comes from cooking (men protect women  
% from other men while they cook, he says). There are just too many  
% different variations on this in different cultures, human interactions  
% are just too complex to pin this on cooking alone. For example there  
% are many tribes that have whole groups of people living together,  
% sharing the cooking. Wrangham even acknowledges these exceptions,  
% but doesn't really address them. I think social norms are far more  
% complex and powerful than "men protect women from other men" and  
% it's a mistake to think that cooking is behind all of it. When we  
% say "we are social animals" we are saying something very complex  
% and profound that goes far beyond any set of simple rules for  
% social interaction.

% If you imagine forward in time - looking towards some future evolutionary trait might accelerate us to some higher form - think about the end of 2001 - you might also look backwards in time and see how first fire and cooking changed us, and then agriculture. These steps in our evolution are just as big as some re-birth as a star baby would be.  
% And what if the bicyle was the next huge evolutionary step - but we missed it or dropped it?

  comment = {Book review about books on animal intelligence. ``Prior to the domestication of plants and the invention of writing, the differences between human societies and those of elephants, dogs, killer whales, and dolphins was a matter of degree, not kind.'' ``The best wolves are brilliant leaders that pursue lifelong strategies in order to lead their families to success. According to wolf watchers, the greatest wolf Yellowstone has ever known was Twenty-one (wolf researchers use numbers rather than names for individuals). He was big and brave, once taking on six attacking wolves and routing them all. He never lost a fight, but he was also magnanimous, for he never killed a vanquished enemy. And that made him as unusual among wolves as did his size and strength.'' ``And human clans willing to tolerate the wolves would have obtained valuable warnings of the presence of danger from other animals (and other humans). Eventually, Safina says, “we became like each other.” The partnership, however, has had some puzzling effects. The brains of dogs, as well as humans, have shrunk since we began living together, perhaps because we came to rely on each other rather than solely on our own wits.'' ``Because female killer whales can live up to eighty years, around a quarter of females in any group are postreproductive. Yet they remain sexually active. Grandmothers are evidently very important in killer whale societies, almost certainly because of the wisdom they have gathered over a lifetime.'' ``At times, killer whales have developed special relationships with people. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, at Twofold Bay south of Sydney, Australia, killer whales and humans set up a mutually profitable whaling enterprise. The killer whales would notify the whalers of the presence of humpback whales by performing a ritual in the waters of the bay fronting the whaler’s cottagers. The men would harpoon the humpbacks, and the killer whales would hold on to the harpoon ropes to tire the prey.  After a humpback was lanced and killed by the men, they observed the “law of the tongue.” The whalers would leave the humpback body for twenty-four hours so that the killers could feast on the lips and tongue. Remarkable proof of this partnership persists, in the form of the skeleton of “Old Tom”—a killer whale whose teeth were worn flat on one side while holding onto harpoon ropes—which can be seen in the killer whale museum in the town of Eden, Australia.'' ``With the exception of our species, killer whales are earth’s most capable predators. When they evolved ten million years ago, half of earth’s whales, seals, and dugong species became extinct.''},
