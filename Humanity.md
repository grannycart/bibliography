}  
% The first chapter reads like Blood Meridian, with scalping and daggers stuck into eye sockets up to the hilt.  
% What's clear from this book is that the notion that western Indians were a gentle peace-loving people has been propagated to the extent that belies the truth. A huge portion of the Indians -- if not the majority -- raised up their warrior class and their culture celebrated masculinity and violence. A man proves oneself by slaying enemies and taking scalps. This was, of course, widely understood in the 20th Century, but it seems like we are losing the central truth of this in the wake of re-branding Indians as peaceful victims who simply had everything stolen from them while they passively stood by. They did not stand by, and they were not passive.  
% Page 57-58: frontier surgeons learned to identify the arrows of different Indian tribes because they could then tell how deeply an arrow was embedded in a man. The worst wounds weren't from bullets or flint arrows, but from arrowheads made of iron the Indians got from whites -- the heads would curl when they hit bone making extraction difficult, damaging, and painful. The animal-tendon bindings would start to dissolve inside men, so the shaft would come out but leave the head behind. Some Indians deliberately left the bindings loose.  
% Somewhere in here (though I lost the exact page) is the story of one Indian coming on a couple of Indians from another tribe who tell him they are chowing down on meat from a soldier they just killed and offer him a bite. But they were just fucking with him.  
% Page 90: Consider a scout of the Shoshone (aligned with the whites) who was out preparing himself for war when the Sioux found him, shot him in the back, and scalped him, "from the nape of the neck to the forehead, leaving his entire skull ghastly and white. It was the boy's first battle."   
% Page 88: "The canyon was in bloom. It is said that the odor of blossoming crabapple, roses, and wild plum mingled sweetly with the dust and acrid smoke of black powder. Gunfire reverberating from the rocky walls echoed the rhythmic pounding of horses' hooves, dislodging thousands of petals which drifted down like keepsakes among the desperate men.  
% Page 90-92: The story of Col. Guy Henry who had his face shot off in the Battle of the Rosebud and survived because a Shoshone war chief, Washakie, stood over him fighting, naked to the waist, and wearing a bonnet with so many feathers they swept the earth (page 88). Henry then survived being carried 200 miles back to Fort Fetterman while being kicked in the head, dropped down a cliff, frozen, almost drowned, his tent shot through, and abused by doctors for days. Supposedly he returned to battle 10 months later.  
% Page 92: "Bourke estimates that Crook and his men took more than fifteen thousand trout in three weeks."  
% Page 129-131: Fetterman's troop of 80-odd men are led into a trap by Indians, slaughtered and mutilated. Graphic descriptions of faces being beaten to a pulp, guts laying about the field, hands and feet severed to the tendons -- everyone except a bugler who went down beating on indians with his bugle, and was left with his body respectfully covered with a buffalo robe.  
% Page 132: "We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women, and children. Nothing less will reach the root of the cause." If one word of this extraordinary telegram is altered it reads like a message from Eichmann to Hitler. (See also quotes from Western newspapers on page 127.)  
% Page 133: Indians eating dogs.  
% Page 136: 8 million buffalo were slaughtered by white people in a three year period up to 1874.  
% Page 137-139: While it was true that Indians made use of every part of the buffalo, it is not true that they used all the buffalo they killed, nor had any particular notions of conservation of the land. They would cut down trees to get at nuts more easily, and start giant prairie fires that would burn through the night. Some species of trees were eliminated by the burning of plains Indians in the 1000 years before the white people arrived. Waste of resources was encouraged by the abundance and by their migratory nature -- you don't care about a particular tree if you won't be back that way for a few years.  
% Page 162-167: scalping goes back to prehistoric times. Ghengis Kahn used to collect human hair from his enemies because it made better rope for catapults. A number of people survived scalping -- graphic descriptions here.  
% Page 214: In describing an "irascible" scholar of Custer: "Furthermore, Mr. Hyde continues as if he had just enjoyed a refreshing sip of vinegar."  
% Page 215: Cheyennes and Sioux would have their toughest warriors wear a sash of wool that was staked to the ground in battle so they could never retreat without victory.  
% Page 216: On the dude who stole Sitting Bull's hand-made illustrated history: "What happened to him after is not known. Perhaps he lived long and happily and boasted to his grandchildren about stealing the famous medicine man's picture book, but one should not bet on it."  
% Page 217: Sitting Bull believed there never was a white man who did not hate Indians and there never was an Indian who did not hate whites.  
% Page 217: Sitting Bull: He asked if whites considered him to be a poor man, but provided the answer himself: "You are fools to make yourselves slaves to a piece of bacon fat, some hardtack, and a little sugar and coffee."  
% Page 218: After Little Bighorn, in the process of bringing Sitting Bull in, they would show Indians, including Sitting Bull, the telephone as a way of demonstrating white man's medicine.  
% Page 219: Sitting Bull said of the US: "The country there is poisoned with blood...."  
% Page 258: Custer was offered Gatling guns, but turned them down because he thought they would slow down his march. Which is true, the carriages were heavy and often got stuck. But that might have actually SAVED him, because he would have arrived later to meet up with the other columns marching and not attackes the Indians alone.  
% Page 259: As is stated earlier in the book a number of times, Custer always charged recklessly into battle. Up until Little Bighorn, he got lucky. At Little Bighorn, being reckless, trying to get all the glory for himself by being first to attack the Indians, cost him everything. (Seems like move fast, break things tech companies could learn a lesson here. Being reckless is great -- as long as you continue to get lucky.)  
% Page 281-282: Indians would execute any wounded white soldiers left on the battlefield. This affected tactics for the whites, in the unlike in conventional warfare where wounded might be left in a field hospital even if that hospital were taken by the enemy, they could never leave wounded behind with Indians. This could sometimes be a severe limitation on the ability of white soldiers to prosecute a fight. Indians thought that the white soldier's policy of caring for wounded was cowardly.  
% Page 301: "And those infuriated braves streaming out of the village must have been as ornamental as charcoal, buffalo blood, pigment, and feathers could make them. One Sioux wrapped himself in the pelt of a bear. Others rode naked, their skin smeared with medicine paint. Perhaps a dozen Cheyennes and forty or fifty Sioux wore bonnets with long trails. White Elk wore a famous headdress designed by his uncle--- the brow embellished with dragonflies and butterflies, a forked-tail swallow sewn between a double row of eagle-down feathers at the trailing end. Sun Bear's bonnet was rudimentary and violent: a single horn projecting from his forehead."

abstract = { The desert regions of the Arabian Peninsula and Levant are criss-crossed by innumerable pathways. Across large areas of north-west Arabia, many of these pathways are flanked by stone monuments, the vast majority of which are ancient tombs. Recent radiometric dating indicates that the most abundant of these monuments, elaborate and morphologically diverse ‘pendant’ structures, were constructed during the mid-to-late third millennium BCE. Thousands of kilometres of these composite path and monument features, ‘funerary avenues’, can be traced across the landscape, especially around and between major perennial water sources. By evidencing routes of human movement during this period, these features provide an emerging source for reconstructing important aspects of ancient mobility and social and economic connectivity. They also provide significant new evidence for human/environment interactions and subsistence strategies during the later Middle Holocene of north-west Arabia, and suggest the parallel existence of mobile pastoralist lifeways and more permanent, oasis-centred settlement. This paper draws upon the results of recent excavations and intensive remote sensing, aerial and ground surveys in Saudi Arabia to present the first detailed examination of these features and the vast cultural landscape that they constitute. },

  Title={The Psychiatrist Who Believed People Could Tell the Future},  
  journal={The New Yorker},  
  date={2019-02-25},  
  comment={Covers the history of mid-century British psychiatrists who set up a premonition hotline to try to gather predictions of tragedies before they happened. Addresses how the nocebo effect (the suggestion that something bad COULD happen -- like giving someone a sugar pill and then telling them it is poison) has a dramatic effect on the physiology of people. A few of the people who call the hotline are eerily good at predicting bad things happened. And those predictions include the death of one of the psychiatrists himself. (However nothing comes of the hotline.)},  
  category={Humanity, Science, Criticality, nocebo, placebo, dreams, clairvoyance, premonition, prediction}  
}
% In a few places the article talks about the conundrum that if a predicted disaster is prevented, then it wouldn't have been a prediction. But not discussed (since this article has _some_ kind of grounding in science, and this issue is unaddressable by science) is the possibility that the time barrier might be able to be broken with some frequency -- some people DO see the future -- it's just that the future can't be changed. Que sera sera, there's nothing we can do to address is. The _reason_ people can see the future is because it already is just as set as the past. A depressing notion, for sure, but aligns with the current thinking that there is no such thing as free will.

  Title={Unfreezing the ice age: the truth about humanity’s deep past},  
  journal={The Guardian},  
  date={2021-10-19},  
  comment={Humanity's deep past is basically so convoluted and complex that the society of it is non-homogeneous and unknowable, at least down to 40k years ago. "If we could travel back in time, this remote past would probably strike us as something more akin to a world inhabited by hobbits, giants and elves than anything we have direct experience of today, or in the more recent past." "What all this brings home is just how radically different the social and physical world of our remote ancestors would have seemed to us – and this would have been true at least down to about 40,000BC. In other words, there is no “original” form of human society. Searching for one can only be a matter of myth-making." "Anthropologists who spend years talking to indigenous people in their own languages, and watching them argue with one another, tend to be well aware that even those who make their living hunting elephants or gathering lotus buds are just as sceptical, imaginative, thoughtful and capable of critical analysis as those who make their living by operating tractors, managing restaurants or chairing university departments." "our remote ancestors were behaving much like Nambikwara. They shifted back and forth between alternative social arrangements, building monuments and then closing them down again, allowing the rise of authoritarian structures during certain times of year then dismantling them. The same individual could experience life in what looks to us sometimes like a band, sometimes a tribe, and sometimes like something with at least some of the characteristics we now identify with states." "In truth, this flexibility, and potential for political self-consciousness, was never entirely lost. Seasonality is still with us – even if it is a pale shadow of its former self. In the Christian world, for instance, there is still the midwinter “holiday season” in which values and forms of organisation do, to a limited degree, reverse themselves: the same media and advertisers who for most of the year peddle rabid consumerist individualism suddenly start announcing that social relations are what’s really important, and that to give is better than to receive."},

Works best with fresh mushrooms. Also covers some of the history of psychedelic mushrooms - mostly in mesoamerica and how that history was repressed by white invaders. Describes the habitat of the mushrooms: they grow on dead plant matter and like disturbed habitats like landslides or eroded places - this means they have benefited greatly from human civilization because humans bring habitat disruption with them everywhere, particularly with civilization. Stamets attributes this to a kind of intelligence on the part of the mushrooms.

The unique thing is the author admits, in some case, to enjoying sex with her father. ``As much as The Incest Diary is a book about pain, it is undeniably also a book about pleasure. The author lusted and lusts still after her father. She is furious when she comes to realize that he also has sex with her mother. When she is eight years old and they move to a new house, she assumes that she will share the master bedroom with him. After her parents divorce two years later, she begins leading her father into his room for sex. Even once the abuse is over, she cannot have an orgasm without seeing her father’s face, “as if my ultimate erotic experience is being raped by the man who created me.” A few times a year, she has a dream in which it is just her and her father, alone in the world, fucking “all we want.” “My father is my secret,” she writes. “But the secret under the secret is that sometimes I liked it. Sometimes I wanted it, and sometimes I seduced him and made him fuck me.'' The reviewer points out that this suggests that consent (or lack of it) is not enough to recognize victims of sexual violence. ``'This is why the question of whether or not a child “wants it” is irrelevant to the morality of pedophilia: not because children don’t want it — or do want it — but because “wanting it” is itself something so easily formed by adult violence. And not just the declaration of the wanting — what is a child’s “let’s fuck” but a simulacrum of consent? — but the wanting itself. When a victim of sexual abuse says she wanted it, she is telling us about the sort of person the abuse required her to be. '},

Touch has been found, among other things, to reduce stress, heart rate and blood pressure. Touch has even been found to lower the level of cortisol in the body (especially in women) which, when elevated, impedes our working memory and, most critically, the immune system’s resiliency. It should be great news that something free, widely available and lacking in harmful side effects is so good for us, but it gets ignored in a touch-averse culture like ours.'' Discusses how men handle stress more poorly than women, by growing stoic or "cowboy" in the face of stress. Women get higher levels of oxytocin when stressed which enhances their ability to cope. But both men and women get higher oxytocin levels through affectionate touch. This "gender role stress" doesn't make men more resilient, it makes then more vulnerable to anxiety and depression, and prevents them from feeling like they should seek mental help. Thus they develop more stress-related disorders like hypertension, alcohol, and drug abuse.},

Right- and left-handers have coexisted at least since the Upper Palaeolithic, and left-handers are in the minority in all human populations. The persistence of the polymorphism of handedness is a puzzle because this trait is substantially heritable and several fitness costs are associated with left-handedness. Some countervailing benefit is required to maintain the polymorphism. Left-handers may have a frequency-dependent advantage in fights--the advantage being greater when their frequency is lower. Sports data from Western societies are consistent with this prediction. Here, we show that the frequency of left-handers is strongly and positively correlated with the rate of homicides across traditional societies. It ranges from 3\% in the most pacifistic societies, to 27\% in the most violent and warlike. This finding is consistent with a frequency-dependent selection mechanism maintaining left-handedness in these societies.},

Agriculture rose with cereal grains specifically because they were easy to tax, while other foods like breadfruit or plantain were not.

% On fire: In “Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States,” James C. Scott, a professor of political science at Yale, presents a plausible contender for the most important piece of technology in the history of man. It is a technology so old that it predates Homo sapiens and instead should be credited to our ancestor Homo erectus. That technology is fire. We have used it in two crucial, defining ways. The first and the most obvious of these is cooking. As Richard Wrangham has argued in his book “Catching Fire,” our ability to cook allows us to extract more energy from the food we eat, and also to eat a far wider range of foods. Our closest animal relative, the chimpanzee, has a colon three times as large as ours, because its diet of raw food is so much harder to digest. The extra caloric value we get from cooked food allowed us to develop our big brains, which absorb roughly a fifth of the energy we consume, as opposed to less than a tenth for most mammals’ brains. That difference is what has made us the dominant species on the planet.  
% The other reason fire was central to our history is less obvious to contemporary eyes: we used it to adapt the landscape around us to our purposes. Hunter-gatherers would set fires as they moved, to clear terrain and make it ready for fast-growing, prey-attracting new plants. They would also drive animals with fire. They used this technology so much that, Scott thinks, we should date the human-dominated phase of earth, the so-called Anthropocene, from the time our forebears mastered this new tool.  
% We don’t give the technology of fire enough credit, Scott suggests, because we don’t give our ancestors much credit for their ingenuity over the long period—ninety-five per cent of human history—during which most of our species were hunter-gatherers. “Why human fire as landscape architecture doesn’t register as it ought to in our historical accounts is perhaps that its effects were spread over hundreds of millennia and were accomplished by ‘precivilized’ peoples also known as ‘savages,’ ” Scott writes. To demonstrate the significance of fire, he points to what we’ve found in certain caves in southern Africa. The earliest, oldest strata of the caves contain whole skeletons of carnivores and many chewed-up bone fragments of the things they were eating, including us. Then comes the layer from when we discovered fire, and ownership of the caves switches: the human skeletons are whole, and the carnivores are bone fragments. Fire is the difference between eating lunch and being lunch.

  comment={Argues that we need to develop a culture of ethical questioning of the decision to have children. Similar to the way we decide whether to buy a house or not. At the moment, the burden is on people who choose NOT to have children to explain themselves. ``In fact, people are still expected to provide reasons not to have children, but no reasons are required to have them. It’s assumed that if individuals do not have children it is because they are infertile, too selfish or have just not yet gotten around to it. In any case, they owe their interlocutor an explanation. On the other hand, no one says to the proud parents of a newborn, Why did you choose to have that child? What are your reasons? The choice to procreate is not regarded as needing any thought or justification.'' ``Such a question also profoundly affects the well-being of existing people (the potential parents, siblings if any, and grandparents). And it has effects beyond the family on the broader society, which is inevitably changed by the cumulative impact — on things like education, health care, employment, agriculture, community growth and design, and the availability and distribution of resources — of individual decisions about whether to procreate.'' ``Perhaps people fail to see childbearing as an ethical choice because they think of it as the expression of an instinct or biological drive, like sexual attraction or “falling in love,” that is not amenable to ethical evaluation. But whatever our biological inclinations may be, many human beings do take control over their fertility, thanks to contemporary means of contraception and abortion.'' ``My aim, I hasten to add, is not to argue for policing people’s procreative motives. I am simply arguing for the need to think systematically and deeply about a fundamental aspect of human life.  The burden of proof — or at least the burden of justification — should therefore rest primarily on those who choose to have children, not on those who choose to be childless.'' ``Because children are dependent, needy and vulnerable, prospective parents should consider how well they can love and care for the offspring they create, and the kind of relationship they can have with them. The genuinely unselfish life plan may at least sometimes be the choice not to have children, especially in the case of individuals who would otherwise procreate merely to adhere to tradition, to please others, to conform to gender conventions, or to benefit themselves out of the inappropriate expectation that children will fix their problems. Children are neither human pets nor little therapists.''},

Of their story he says ``It’s hard to diagram the Kaweah story as an allegory of any contemporary ideology of good and evil, heroism and villainy. It gets confusing: The federal government, partly at the behest of an underhanded corporation, sabotaged a community of hardworking and benevolent utopians — but only to create something fundamentally idealistic and to protect an irreplaceable ecological wonder from capitalistic loggers. And yet, the loggers were the utopians. The capitalists were socialists! Which would have been fine, except that the government had mistaken them for an underhanded corporation. Baffled, I called William Tweed, the retired Sequoia park ranger, who has also written about the colony. “You reach a stage in life where what you most frequently see in history is irony,” Tweed told me sagely. “Perhaps the lesson for 2017 is that ideology rarely explains what happens.”'' },

  comment={This book.},  
  category={Science, natural selection, evolution, sexual selection},  
}  
% At first I was thinking: how could people who have been breeding animals for thousands of years not realize that natural selection was going on.  
% Darwin actually answers this question: breeders up to the 19th century always thought they were making choices to mix breeds that were separately decsended from wile breeds. Unconsciously the selected the most fit animasls from their stock for breeding, but with most animals it was difficult to see change to the breed within a human lifetime.  
% What this suggests most to me is how deeply ingrained in our thinking natural selection is now in a post-darwin world that I just assumed breeders should have realized this.  
% Another interesing thing is that Darwin is careful to cite influences and sources. He makes it very clear that he is the person who best articulated a theory that had been boiling for some time. It is not at all that he just popped this thing out of his head, he just put all the pieces together. The theory evolved.  
% In arguing that there is no difference between what 19th century scientists were call "species" and "varieties" he points out that while most of the scientists were focussing on the similarties of animals, chunking them together into "species" he wanted to focus on the small differences that set them apart - for those small differences are the things that he believed led to new species. Page 45  
% This is interesting: it suggests that paying attention to the details, not being lured in by the larger themes that may already exist in the general thought of the culture you are in, may lead you to a whole new set of larger themes.  
% 19th century science is a really different thing: it still has elements of statistics, but it's really about _observation_. While modern science is essentially nothing but statistics.  
% I think we still try to sell kids on the idea that science is observation - "experiments" are bubbling beakers or setting various things on fire to see what would happen, or disecting things to see how they work. This is a very 19th century version of science and has little (though not completely nothing) to do with the statistics and math based science of modern times that is actually fairly dull in everyday practice.  
% He refers to shipwrecked sailors near shore - how it's better for strong swimmers to be stronger, and for weak swimmers to be weaker (and so stay with the wreck). ~Page 105  
% He talks about how it is known among domestic animals that they vary purely in reaction to climate: like dogs growing a thicker coat in the cold. But he thinks that is a small effect compared to natural variation responding to climate.  
% Darwin says that science can't be responsive to vox populi vox dei. He gives the example that science had to recognize that the earth revolves around the sun, not the other way around, even if popular opinion was otherwise.  
% A thing that comes up over and over again with Darwin is the SCALE of time required for natural selection (he never says "evolution") to take place. This is another area where part of our blindness to this theory is the difficulty of humans to deal with the sheer scale of geological time scales.  
% Reading Darwin in the light of Patrick O'Brian really makes you think about disection. Darwin often includes descriptions of viscera that border on gross.  
% Darwin doesn't really have much trouble with the eye. But the electric organs of fish, on the other hand, creates a real problem. Page 139  
% He says other authors have a view of nature "like a toy store" wity variety for varieties sake. Page 142. Though this does make one wonder if perhaps the variety IS there for the entertainment... of _someone_.  
% I start to wonder about the effect of inheritance, which D does mention briefly. Consider the fact that so many mammals have 5 bones in their "fingers" adapted in a billion ways. (See page 147.)  But why five? Obviously if growing a sixth finger helps a species, it will happen, but in most cases they just have 5 because that's what their ancestors had. And then those 5 evolve into wings or flippers or whatever, where essentially there is only 1 or 2 digits for functional purposes. Those digits might just as easily contained 3 or 8 bone structures. - see page 334 where he kind of picks this topic up.  
% Darwin points out that flowers are beautiful soley to catch the eye of the insect in a field of green. (Page 147)  
% Darwin says, "I may first remark that this sense of beauty obviously depends on the nature of the mind, irrespective of any real quality in the admired object; and that idea of what is beautiful, is not innate or unalterable. We see this, for instance, in the men of different races admiring an entirely differeny standard of beauty in their women." Page 147.  
% I do believe that biologists, when examining some funky part or behavior an animal evoled, almost immediately fall back on it being for obtaining food or sex.  
% I think this is an equivalent simplistic understanding of the world as the "rational actor" is of economics.  
% Think of play - it isn't for food or sex. But it allows the animal to develop it's brain, (which granted, might yield more food later). The behavior is directly for nothing more than fun. Periods of rest are similar. They have long-term benefits for food or sex, but the immediate benefit might be pleasure, social company, or entertainment. We KNOW animals get bored - think of pets left home alone. Why do biologists never think that might be part of an animals behavior in the wild? Or that animals might evolve structures that are part of their entertainment behavior?  
% See \url{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/parenting/animal-behavior-play-games.html}  
% There's also structures that remain from some use in the past, sometimes repurposed for other uses.  
% And there's simply individual preferences. A single individual might have ANY kind of bahvior (it would be part of the variation of natural selection). I think biologists DO understand that though.  
% Natural selection is a simple concept in stating that species develop useful characteristics to survive better than their competitors. It is complex because the rules of the competition are not always clear to humans with their short life-spans and limited fossil record. Particularly in the use of energy: a person might say: why didn't an animal evolve some kind of ranged weapon? or some other fantastical device. But there's two big reasons it didn't: one it had to come from something that already existed, and two there is not unlimited energy to power new structures. This is why disued structures tend to fade away too. One big factor often overlooked: how much energy is available to power the development of a new structure.  
% It's funny that humans have such a poor undersanding of energy consumption as a part of animal life. (See bike racing.) One would think that it would be an inherently instinctive thing. And maybe it is at some deep physical level. But we have not conscious recognition of it.  
% D says "the most serious special difficulty my theory has encountered" is the problem of neuter insects (not the eye). That is, worker ants who evolved special adaptations like extra armor or giant jaws, but are neuter and can't pass on their adaptation to offspring.  
% His conclusion (I assume rightly) is that the worker ants themselves could be seen as adaptations of the the fertile ants. This is possible among social animals (already you can see early hints at thinking of any colonies as a whole organism, not individuals). For social animals it is possible to have sterile workers who develop special adaptations because those sterile individuals help the fertile ones to flourish. He also includes here a funny example of degrees of variation by talking about construction workers who might be from 5 to 15 feet high, wich giant jaws and heads.  
% See page 205 and nearby pages in chapter on instincts.  
% The instincts chapter also includes some neat descriptions of the cuckoo's habit of laying eggs in other bird's next and pushing the other bird's young out of the nest. And also detailed descriptions of slave making ants.  
% He briefly mentions in the instinct chapter the ant habit of farming aphids. Even he calls the aphids "cattle". The fact that ants are carrying out agriculture is not missed by him.  
% (In this edition) Darwin mentions Archaeopteryx on page 251  
% Darwin struggles with the age of the earth. He is up against the current thinking that the Earth is relatively young (vs today's standards) thousands or millions of years old. Darwin tries to epmhasize how long a million years is. He says that huge amounts of time must have been necessary for natural seleciton to occur - he suggests many millions if not hundreds of millions of years. Little does he suspect that the scales he is talking about are far smaller than reality - BILLIONS of years.  
% This was written long before the theory of plate tectonics, and that causes Darwin some trouble trying to explain why different species are very similar in very different places. But he does suggest that maybe the oceans the continents have not always been where they are now. Page 276  
% Darwin proposed two be challenges to a species success that evolution has to overcome: the nature of the environment into a which a species moves, and other species against which it has to competete. At the time he was writing, a LOT of stock was put into being fit for a new environment. But Darwin argues that it is actually competition that matters most. He saw this in the Galapagos. P. 311  
% [Origin is a good example of how to "write the book" on something. The theory is broad and very generalized. The kind of thing you could come up with sitting around your sitting room. It fits well, and makes sense, but there are also lots of exceptions, some of which Darwin can't explain (in some cases because the science just wasn't there to support him yet - like plate tectonics and the age the Earth). Being broad and not always working doesn't matter though. What makes it convincing, is years and years of examples collected and applied. If one wanted to write a book that changes the whole way people see the world, with lasting impacts, this is a good model.]  
% There's some interesting comment on hair, beards, and skin color towards the end of Descent of Man.  
% "When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a long history; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, in the same way as any great mechanical invention is the summing up of the labor, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, I speak from experience, does the study of natural history become!" Page 371  
% Darwin's ideas of sexual selection were largely ignored until the 1980s, scientists assumes that natural selection actually accounted for sexual selection, in complicated ways - like bright feathers signaled a healthy immune system or something. Further research indicated that while this was sometimes true, more often sexual selection was happening for traits that couldn't really be explained as natural selection. Richard Prum put forth a theory in the 1980s that animals made choices that affect their evolution based on beauty, and that there is no way to understand why certain things would be regarded as beautiful by animals. More modern thinking is that sexual selection is driven by a number of mechanisms, not least that sometimes environment and perception of the enviornment shape what animals value and select for.

% ``one particular aspect of his argument is his distress at the idea that almost all evolutionary change is assumed to be adaptive, contributing to fitness. In other words, if a fish is blue, it must be blue for a reason. The color must help it escape predators or sneak up on prey, or be otherwise useful in some way. Beauty, therefore, must be adaptive, or a sign of underlying qualities that are adaptive. Pick a behavior or an ornament or a physical trait, and it is useful until proven otherwise. That’s backward, says Dr. Prum. Take beauty. Since animals have aesthetic preferences and make choices, beauty will inevitably appear. “Beauty happens,” as he puts it, and it should be taken as nonadaptive until proven otherwise.''

# 1 - this is a classic example of philosophers arguing/thinknig about stuff that is fundamentally unknowable. Who cares if higher forces are occasionally interveneing in our lives if there's no way to know if it's true or not? Just acknowledge the possibility and move on.  
% 2 - Who says the higher purpose is GOOD? To make the experiment "interesting" would mean keeping it from collapsing - potentially seen as a "good" - but also possibly stirring the pot: say by making Trump president.  
% We as humans really WANT our lives to be meaningful, to serve some "higher purpose" but while Gould might be wrong that evolution is completely random, maybe what he sees as "random" is actually a higher purpose that want both good and bad things to happen - because they, like us, would find only good things happening to be terrifically dull.

}  
% She frames killing and dying as "work" and that killing demanded the "harder courage". Page 32  
% A lot of this book is about Civil War-era folks desparately trying to maintain their Christian beliefs in the face of the horrors of war. Particularly regarding the idea of "the good death" where the dying indicates in some way that they are surely going on to the after life.  
% Traditionally the good death would have happened at home, surrounded by friends and family who could see the dying as they passed on to the afterlife. The war forced many many men to die far from home, and so a lot of this book is taken up with various ways families resolved that: through the development of embalming and special caskets, accounts of last words on the battle fields, or even last letters from the dying. But sometimes this war in an era that was becoming industrial would just completely disintegrate some men. Many just disappeared entirely.  
% Spiritualism became huge during the war because of this - many cults and people believed they could talk to the dead. Mediums sprang up, one magazine even published regular messages from beyond the grave (for a very long time after the war ended too). The planchette was developed - an early version of the ouiji board - a parlor game which people could buy and play to communicate with the dead. Page 182  
% There's some interesting ideas mentioned in here (I've lost the page references) to the timeless fact that men felt most alive in battles, and that the will to go into battle is primarily derived from the sense of duty to the other men in their immediate circle of the war. This suggests interesting things about men in gangs in cities - it's potentially the same things that would have to be overcome - the sense that this is their MOST alive time of life, and commitment to their friends above all else - even family, country, religion.  
% She says that Paul Fussell says wars always beget irony because intentions are always overturned by circumstance. Wars outcome is always much more horrible than we can anticipate. Page 194.  
% Of course we are STILL obsessed with the idea of the "good death" really: \url{https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/opinion/what-our-cells-teach-us-about-a-natural-death.html}

% Cherry-Garrard's note on what book to bring with you on a sledging journey (notably: Bleak House and Origin of the Species):  
% I have already spoken of the importance of maps and books of reference,  
% and these should include a good encyclopaedia and dictionaries, English,  
% Latin and Greek. Oates was generally deep in Napier's History of the  
% Peninsular War, and some of us found Herbert Paul's History of Modern  
% England a great stand-by. Most of us managed to find room in our  
% personal gear when sledging for some book which did not weigh much and  
% yet would last. Scott took some Browning on the Polar Journey, though I  
% only saw him reading it once; Wilson took Maud and In Memoriam; Bowers  
% always had so many weights to tally and observations to record on  
% reaching camp that I feel sure he took no reading matter. Bleak House  
% was the most successful book I ever took away sledging, though a volume  
% of poetry was useful, because it gave one something to learn by heart  
% and repeat during the blank hours of the daily march, when the idle  
% mind is all too apt to think of food in times of hunger, or possibly  
% of purely imaginary grievances, which may become distorted into real  
% foundations of discord under the abnormal strain of living for months  
% in the unrelieved company of three other men. If your companions have  
% much the same tastes as yourself it is best to pool your allowance of  
% weights and take one book which will offer a wide field of thought and  
% discussion. I have heard Scott and Wilson bless the thought which led  
% them to take Darwin's Origin of Species on their first Southern Journey.  
% Such is the object of your sledging book, but you often want the book  
% which you read for half an hour before you go to sleep at Winter  
% Quarters to take you into the frivolous fripperies of modern social life  
% which you may not know and may never wish to know, but which it is often

% The word tattoo enters the English language when Cook visits Tahiti, page 78   
% The idea of cannibalism (particularly in the south pacific) enters Western consciousness when Cook visits New Zealand, page 104    
% "Kangaroo" was long thought to be a misinterpretation by Cook and Banks of the word said by the aboriginals. Right into modern times it was told that "kangaroo" meant something like "what did you say?" But in fact Cook and Banks got a list of common words from the local aboriginals, and they were fairly accurate, including the term for the animal. Page, 124   
% On a later visit to New Zealand, during the second voyage, the Maori horrified the Europeans by eating the flesh of a young boy they had killed in battle. ...Then Cook and another crew member ask the Moari to do it again, (to prove for certain that they partake in cannibalism) and even slice off and cook the meat on the ship.  
% The book points out that while the Moari do sometimes eat the flesh of enemies killed in battle, it probably wasn't super common. Another aspect of the Moari culture is to do things that are intimidating or defy conventions for the pleasure of doing it. As in their haka war dance. It is very likely that they were eating the flesh FOR the Europeans, essentially to freak them out. Page 211  
% The OTHER ship on Cook's second voyage (not with Cook on board) was long separated from Cook. On landing at New Zealand there was an incident where one of the boats of that ship went off to meet islanders at Grass Cove, insulted them, were all killed and eaten. Later their cooked parts were discovered by other members of that ship. page 252  
% The search for the Northwest Passage was predicated on the (false) belief that seawater doesn't freeze. (Elsewhere, it's explained that when seawater freezes, it precipitates out the salt, so melted seawater yields fresh water.) Since it was believed that ice in the north and south only came from nearby freshwater rivers, it was also believed that a Northwest Passage could exist. Cook's third voyage was sent out to find it.

When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, written language or the development among Eurasians of resistance to endemic diseases), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian genomes.''},

In the present book focusing on collapses rather than buildups, I compare many past and present societies that differed with respect to environmental fragility, relations with neighbors, political institutions, and other "input" variables postulated to influence a society's stability. The "output" variables that I examine are collapse or survival, and form of the collapse if collapse does occur.

  comment = {Book review about books on animal intelligence. ``Prior to the domestication of plants and the invention of writing, the differences between human societies and those of elephants, dogs, killer whales, and dolphins was a matter of degree, not kind.'' ``The best wolves are brilliant leaders that pursue lifelong strategies in order to lead their families to success. According to wolf watchers, the greatest wolf Yellowstone has ever known was Twenty-one (wolf researchers use numbers rather than names for individuals). He was big and brave, once taking on six attacking wolves and routing them all. He never lost a fight, but he was also magnanimous, for he never killed a vanquished enemy. And that made him as unusual among wolves as did his size and strength.'' ``And human clans willing to tolerate the wolves would have obtained valuable warnings of the presence of danger from other animals (and other humans). Eventually, Safina says, “we became like each other.” The partnership, however, has had some puzzling effects. The brains of dogs, as well as humans, have shrunk since we began living together, perhaps because we came to rely on each other rather than solely on our own wits.'' ``Because female killer whales can live up to eighty years, around a quarter of females in any group are postreproductive. Yet they remain sexually active. Grandmothers are evidently very important in killer whale societies, almost certainly because of the wisdom they have gathered over a lifetime.'' ``At times, killer whales have developed special relationships with people. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, at Twofold Bay south of Sydney, Australia, killer whales and humans set up a mutually profitable whaling enterprise. The killer whales would notify the whalers of the presence of humpback whales by performing a ritual in the waters of the bay fronting the whaler’s cottagers. The men would harpoon the humpbacks, and the killer whales would hold on to the harpoon ropes to tire the prey.  After a humpback was lanced and killed by the men, they observed the “law of the tongue.” The whalers would leave the humpback body for twenty-four hours so that the killers could feast on the lips and tongue. Remarkable proof of this partnership persists, in the form of the skeleton of “Old Tom”—a killer whale whose teeth were worn flat on one side while holding onto harpoon ropes—which can be seen in the killer whale museum in the town of Eden, Australia.'' ``With the exception of our species, killer whales are earth’s most capable predators. When they evolved ten million years ago, half of earth’s whales, seals, and dugong species became extinct.''},
