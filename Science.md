_Some thoughts of my own:_  
_We live in the age of empiricism, but no one can know vast empirical knowledge beyond their own field. And so, we continue to *understand* as in the age of romanticism. This makes us vulnerable to propaganda (of the heart) but at the same time invests our world with rich meaning._

  category={Science, statistics, p-value}  
}  
  
% To understand what p-value is, you first need to understand what a null  
% hypothesis is. When running a hypothesis test/experiment, the null hypothesis  
% says that there is no difference or no change between the two tests. The  
% alternate hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis and states that  
% there is a difference between the two tests. The goal of the experiment is  
% usually to disprove the null hypothesis, and to prove/test the alternate  
% hypothesis. Let me illustrate this with some examples.  
%   
% If you are trying to test whether a new marketing campaign generates more  
% revenue, the null hypothesis is that there is no change in the revenue as a  
% result of the new marketing campaign. And the alternate hypothesis is that the  
% new marketing campaign performs better (or worse) than the previous campaign.  
% If you are trying to prove that a new drug lowers cholesterol, the null  
% hypothesis states that there is no difference in cholesterol between the group  
% with the drug and the group without, while the alternate hypothesis states that  
% the new drug does have an effect on cholesterol levels. If you are trying to  
% test whether a new server version has better or worse performance than the  
% previous version, the null hypothesis is that both server versions have equal  
% performance. And the alternate hypothesis is that there is a meaningful  
% difference in the performance of the old and new server.  
%   
% So what is the simple layman's definition of p-value? The p-value is the  
% probability that the null hypothesis is true. That's it.  
%   
% In the example where we are trying to test whether a new marketing campaign  
% generates more revenue, the p-value is the probability that the null  
% hypothesis, which states that there is no change in the revenue as a result of  
% the new marketing campaign, is true. If the value of the p-value is 0.25, then  
% there is a 25% probability that there is no real increase or decrease in  
% revenue as a result of the new marketing campaign. If the value of the p-value  
% is 0.04 then there is a 4% probability that there is no real increase or  
% decrease in revenue as a result of the new marketing campaign. As you can  
% surmise, the lower the p-value, the more confident we are that the alternate  
% hypothesis is true, which, in this case, means that the new marketing campaign  
% causes an increase or decrease in revenue.

Until now, no individual taxa have been suggested as distinct and characteristic new morphospecies representing this change. Here we show that the domestic broiler chicken is one such potential marker. Human-directed changes in breeding, diet and farming practices demonstrate at least a doubling in body size from the late medieval period to the present in domesticated chickens, and an up to fivefold increase in body mass since the mid-twentieth century. Moreover, the skeletal morphology, pathology, bone geochemistry and genetics of modern broilers are demonstrably different to those of their ancestors. Physical and numerical changes to chickens in the second half of the twentieth century, i.e. during the putative Anthropocene Epoch, have been the most dramatic, with large increases in individual bird growth rate and population sizes. Broiler chickens, now unable to survive without human intervention, have a combined mass exceeding that of all other birds on Earth; this novel morphotype symbolizes the unprecedented human reconfiguration of the Earth's biosphere. },

What we see and experience in our dreams might not necessarily be real, but the emotions attached to these experiences certainly are. Our dream stories essentially try to strip the emotion out of a certain experience by creating a memory of it. This way, the emotion itself is no longer active.  This mechanism fulfils an important role because when we don’t process our emotions, especially negative ones, this increases personal worry and anxiety. In fact, severe REM sleep-deprivation is increasingly correlated to the development of mental disorders. In short, dreams help regulate traffic on that fragile bridge which connects our experiences with our emotions and memories.''},

We examined the relative roles of natural selection, genetic drift and gene flow in influencing the evolution of white clover (Trifolium repens), which thrives in urban and rural areas. Trifolium repens exhibits a Mendelian polymorphism for the production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a potent antiherbivore defence. We quantified the relative frequency of HCN in 490 populations sampled along urban{\textendash}rural transects in 20 cities. We also characterized genetic variation within 120 populations in eight cities using 16 microsatellite loci. HCN frequency increased by 0.6\% for every kilometre from an urban centre, and the strength of this relationship did not significantly vary between cities. Populations did not exhibit changes in genetic diversity with increasing urbanization, indicating that genetic drift is unlikely to explain urban{\textendash}rural clines in HCN frequency. Populations frequently exhibited isolation-by-distance and extensive gene flow along most urban{\textendash}rural transects, with the exception of a single city that exhibited genetic differentiation between urban and rural populations. Our results show that urbanization repeatedly drives parallel evolution of an ecologically important trait across many cities that vary in size, and this evolution is best explained by urban{\textendash}rural gradients in natural selection.},

% are used to try to suggest something about human behavior, often

% suggested by most of this science are small truths at best, and at worst  
% reflecting nothing more than current cultural conditions - which can not

% Eagleman (and presumably other neural scientists studying these kinds of

  Title={Wind Chill Blows},  
  journal={Slate},  
  date={2010-01-07},  
  comment={Why wind chill is a meaningless number. The initial experiments that led to wind chill calculations were grossly wrong. Around year 2000 some scientists tried to update it, but still made assumptions that apply to almost no one: ``Osczevski and Bluestein made a set of new assumptions to determine wind-chill-equivalent temperatures. Namely, they geared their calculations toward people who are 5 feet tall, somewhat portly, and walk at an even clip directly into the wind. They also left out crucial variables that have an important effect on how we experience the weather, like solar radiation. Direct sunlight can make us feel 10 to 15 degrees warmer, even on a frigid winter day. The wind chill equivalent temperature, though, assumes that we're taking a stroll in the dead of night.'' But even if they created a more accurate model, wind chill doesn't really tell you how cold your skin will get - that is air temperature alone - just the RATE at which your skin will reach air temperature. You'll feel colder FASTER in a stiff wind, but it isn't actually any COLDER. -40 with still air is far far colder than -10 with -40 wind chill. Argues that the best way to understand how weather will affect us is to simply look out the window. Weathermen can give us data, but each of us as individuals have to understand how that affects us alone.},

  comment={Covers the scientific phenomenon of "the decline effect" (a term re-coined in this article). This is where in some cases rigorous scientific study shows a declining effect over time, the more studies are done or replicated about a given finding. Recounts the story of Jonathan Schooler (also told in a RadioLab short) where his finding that the more people try to put a memory into words, the less accurate they are about the memory. (He calls it "verbal overshadowing".) But his findings were less robust the more he studied the phenomenon. Various explanations are floated, including regression to the mean (but it doesn't explain linear decline, it only explains a single extraordinary finding), and publication bias, where scientists tend to publish only positive findings (though this doesn't explain Schooler and a few other's rigorous findings.) It could also be perception bias - where even good scientists make mistakes that trend positive because they are human doing very very complex measurements. Scientists are also affected by cultural factors: in Asia 47 studies of acupuncture all found it effective, while of 94 studies of acupuncture in Western countries only 56 percent found it effective. This article also quotes John Ioannidis, who describes "significance chasing" where scientists try to find ways to get their findings over the 95 percent significance boundary. (A boundary which this article claims was basically an arbitrary boundary.) He says the pursuit of replicability distracts from the real problem: faulty experiment design.},

% According to Wikipedia this article caused a lot of controversy because the ending might suggest the scientific process doesn't work: "Just because an idea is true doesn’t mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn’t mean it’s true. When the experiments are done, we still have to choose what to believe."  
% Lehrer responded to these criticisms by reinforcing that theories like evolution and global warming are real. The scientific method works - when enough studies are applied to it.  
% RadioLab and On The Media covered this, and raised the possible explanation as some larger problem with the universe in general - maybe something like the act of observing phenomena actually changes the results. This of course is only a theory, that could only be a real possibility if the other explanations are more firmly eliminated.  
% Wikipedia covers some of the controversy around this article, pointing out that most of the studies showing the decline effect are in areas of social science, that involve humans - who are notoriously more complex to study. Harder sciences, like physics, have less of this issue.  
% There is little follow up to this article and criticism that I can find 8 years later. It seems like this blew up as a controversy for a short while, and then most people forgot about it.

We analyzed the bacterial microbiome of used kitchen sponges by 454{\^a}??pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes and fluorescence in situ hybridization coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy (FISH{\^a}??CLSM). Pyrosequencing showed a relative dominance of Gammaproteobacteria within the sponge microbiota. Five of the ten most abundant OTUs were closely related to risk group 2 (RG2) species, previously detected in the BE and kitchen microbiome. Regular cleaning of sponges, indicated by their users, significantly affected the microbiome structure. Two of the ten dominant OTUs, closely related to the RG2-species Chryseobacterium hominis and Moraxella osloensis, showed significantly greater proportions in regularly sanitized sponges, thereby questioning such sanitation methods in a long term perspective. FISH{\^a}??CLSM showed an ubiquitous distribution of bacteria within the sponge tissue, concentrating in internal cavities and on sponge surfaces, where biofilm{\^a}??like structures occurred. Image analysis showed local densities of up to 5.4{\^a}??*{\^a}??1010 cells per cm3, and confirmed the dominance of Gammaproteobacteria.

Something similar occurred with remnants of the “Stuxnet” worm that the United States and Israel used against Iran’s nuclear program nearly seven years ago. Elements of those tools frequently appear in other, less ambitious attacks.'' ``The attacks on Friday are likely to raise significant questions about whether the growing number of countries developing and stockpiling cyberweapons can avoid having those same tools purloined and turned against their own citizens.  They also showed how easily a cyberweapon can wreak havoc, even without shutting off a country’s power grid or its cellphone network.'' Microsoft had released a patch for this, but while they usually credit the person who found the exploit, in this case it was anonymous, leading people to point the finger at the N.S.A. itself revealing the exploit to Microsoft because they knew it had been stolen from them. ``Privacy activists said if that were the case, the government would be to blame for the fact that so many companies were left vulnerable to Friday’s attacks.

This finding helps us understand why my colleagues and I have found that factual and scientific evidence is often ineffective at reducing misperceptions and can even backfire on issues like weapons of mass destruction, health care reform and vaccines. With science as with politics, identity often trumps the facts.'' One possible solution is to try to break the connection between identity and factual beliefs --- so a Republican might still believe in climate change. But also there is a need to reduce incentives for elites to spread misinformation to their followers. ``Once people’s cultural and political views get tied up in their factual beliefs, it’s very difficult to undo regardless of the messaging that is used.'' ``The deeper problem is that citizens participate in public life precisely because they believe the issues at stake relate to their values and ideals, especially when political parties and other identity-based groups get involved – an outcome that is inevitable on high-profile issues. Those groups can help to mobilize the public and represent their interests, but they also help to produce the factual divisions that are one of the most toxic byproducts of our polarized era.''},

Most subsequent attine agricultural evolution, including the domestication event that produced the ancestor of higher attine cultivars, is likewise hypothesized to have occurred in South American rainforests. The {\textquoteleft}out-of-the-rainforest{\textquoteright} hypothesis, while generally accepted, has never been tested in a phylogenetic context. It also presents a problem for explaining how fungal domestication might have occurred,  
given that isolation from free-living populations is required. Here, we use phylogenomic data from ultra-conserved element (UCE) loci to reconstruct the evolutionary history of fungus-farming  
ants, reduce topological uncertainty, and identify the closest non-fungus-growing ant relative.  
Using the phylogeny we infer the history of attine agricultural systems, habitat preference and  
biogeography. Our results show that the out-of-the-rainforest hypothesis is correct with regard  
to the origin of attine ant agriculture; however, contrary to expectation, we find that the transition from lower to higher agriculture is very likely to have occurred in a seasonally dry habitat, inhospitable to the growth of free-living populations of attine fungal cultivars. We suggest that dry habitats favoured the isolation of attine cultivars over the evolutionary time spans  
necessary for domestication to occur.},

Tickling is rewarding through dopaminergic mechanisms, but the function and neural correlates of ticklishness are unknown. We confirmed that tickling of rats evoked vocalizations, approach, and unsolicited jumps (Freudenspr{\"u}nge). Recordings in the trunk region of the rat somatosensory cortex showed intense tickling-evoked activity in most neurons, whereas a minority of cells were suppressed by tickling. Tickling responses predicted nontactile neural responses to play behaviors, which suggests a neuronal link between tickling and play. Anxiogenic conditions suppressed tickling-evoked vocalizations and trunk cortex activity. Deep-layer trunk cortex neurons discharged  
during vocalizations, and deep-layer microstimulation evoked vocalizations. Our findings provide evidence for deep-layer trunk cortex activity as a neural correlate of ticklishness.},

  comment={A short description of the epic migration of eels from their continental freshwater to secret spawning grounds in the Sargasso Sea (where they die after spawning).

We provide the first spatially continuous map of forest tree density at a global scale.

Of these trees, approximately 1.39 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.61 trillion in temperate regions. Biome-level trends in tree density demonstrate the importance of climate and topography in controlling local tree densities at finer scales, as well as the overwhelming effect of humans across most of the world. Based on our projected tree densities, we estimate that over 15 billion trees are cut down each year, and the global number of trees has fallen by approximately 46\% since the start of human civilization.},

Rather they found that the traies of higher cognitive ability, more educated parents, and better impulse control are better indicators for success, as demonstrated by decades of social science. Also insecurity actually detracted from success while emotional stability increased success. And there's no ``synergy'' between the traits of the trple package.

% It was interesting for these guys to take up the challenge of a psych-pop theory, and debunk it. I like that they address this issues of science's role in culture. Not fully addressed here is the fact that so much of science IS influenced by pop culture. Not just through pop culture putting forward theories that need testing (which probably actually get the smallest amount of scientific testing) but more from the influence of pop VALUES on what scientists decide to study.  
% But really, is there any difference between a scientist writing a white paper to suggest something that should be studied, and some smart people putting out a book that suggests something that should be studied? I think the only problem really is that I'm sure the book is framed as something that is true, whereas it really should be framed as something that should be studied. But the scientists could be doing that work for pop culture. Engage with theories out there, and say, 'hey, that's interesting, we need to study this.'

Nearly a century ago, scientists began to realise that non-living systems could behave as self-organisers that ‘suck orderliness’ from their environment. That notion was formalised in the 1960s by the Russian chemist Ilya Prigogine, who called such self-organising systems dissipative structures. Such structures are easy to find: simply pull the plug in a bathtub and watch a whirlpool form. Driven by gravity, the water molecules spontaneously swirl into a pattern that is more ordered than their previous haphazard collection. Because it makes the water drain more quickly, the whirlpool increases global entropy by making a lower-entropy local structure. If the tub is continually filled at an equal rate – say by running the shower – the whirlpool will persist indefinitely. When energy can continuously flow through a system, interesting things begin to happen.''},

Like the coastline the brain has a power law distribution, not a normal distribution, which means that is has no average (or specific thing) that could be the most powerful part or root of how it works. ``If power law distributions are so common in the brain, they must be telling us something about how it operates.  Why does the brain transcend bell-curve averages?  One possible explanation is that the brain lacks a privileged scale because its functioning cannot be reduced to component parts (i.e., neurons).  Rather, it is the complex interactions between parts which give rise to phenomena at all spatial and temporal scales. If this hypothesis is true, it does not bode well for the Blue Brain Project.  Like averages, reductionism is deeply ingrained in our scientific thinking.  Water is explained in terms of molecules, molecules in terms of atoms, etc.  If the brain is reducible to simpler parts, it should also exhibit a privileged scale of organization.'' `` A unifying mechanism for power law behavior in the brain and other systems is that of self-organized criticality (SOC).  According to this model, systems such as the brain operate on the brink of instability, exhibiting slow processes that build energy and fast processes that dissipate energy.  In such systems, small causes have effects of many sizes.''},

Represented by approximately 70\% of the postcranial skeleton, plus craniodental remains, Dreadnoughtus is the most complete giant titanosaur yet discovered, and provides new insight into the morphology and evolutionary history of these colossal animals. Furthermore, despite its estimated mass of about 59.3 metric tons, the bone histology of the Dreadnoughtus type specimen reveals that this individual was still growing at the time of death.},

        abstract = {The importance of exercise for health and neurogenesis is becoming increasingly clear. Wheel running is often used in the laboratory for triggering enhanced activity levels, despite the common objection that this behaviour is an artefact of captivity and merely signifies neurosis or stereotypy. If wheel running is indeed caused by captive housing, wild mice are not expected to use a running wheel in nature. This however, to our knowledge, has never been tested. Here, we show that when running wheels are placed in nature, they are frequently used by wild mice, also when no extrinsic reward is provided. Bout lengths of running wheel behaviour in the wild match those for captive mice. This finding falsifies one criterion for stereotypic behaviour, and suggests that running wheel activity is an elective behaviour. In a time when lifestyle in general and lack of exercise in particular are a major cause of disease in the modern world, research into physical activity is of utmost importance. Our findings may help alleviate the main concern regarding the use of running wheels in research on exercise.},

  comment = {There is little evidence to suggest that recycling has any environmental benefit, except for paper and aluminum. It is indeed mostly a religious ritual practiced by a certain class, which is fine except that they want to impose their religion on everyone. The optimal recycling rate is likely far below what politicians have been calling for. ``He concludes that the social good would be optimized by subsidizing the recycling of some metals, and by imposing a 15 tax on each ton of trash that goes to the landfill. That tax would offset the environmental costs, chiefly the greenhouse impact, and allow each municipality to make a guilt-free choice based on local economics and its citizens’ wishes. The result, Dr. Kinnaman predicts, would be a lot less recycling than there is today.''

New research suggests that other older species evolved with the clit inside the vagina, and the orgasm singnaled the release of the egg. But primates/humans developed social circles with regular sex so a signal to release the egg became unecessary and women evolved regular menstrual cycles. (So fascinating! Menstrual cycles exist because of the existence of _social_ structures!) The clitoris evolved away from the vagina to keep the singnals separate (this part is a little hard to believe.)

  abstract = {We test for a ‘hot hand’ (i.e., short-term streakiness in performance) in Major League Baseball using panel data. We find strong evidence for its existence in all ten statistical categories we consider. The magnitudes are significant; being ‘hot’ corresponds to roughly a one quartile increase in the distribution. Our results are in notable contrast to the majority of the hot hand literature, which has found little to no evidence for a hot hand in sports, often employing basketball shooting data. We argue that this difference is attributable to endogenous defensive responses: basketball presents sufficient opportunity for defensive responses to equate shooting probabilities across players whereas baseball does not. As such, prior evidence on the absence of a hot hand (despite widespread belief in its presence) should not be interpreted as a cognitive mistake – as it typically is in the literature – but rather as an efficient equilibrium adjustment. We provide a heuristic manner for identifying a priori which sports are likely to permit an equating endogenous response response and discuss potential implications for identifying the hot hand effect in other settings.},
