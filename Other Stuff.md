And the history of claims of plant memory in the form of the Sovient leading "scientist" Lysenko --- who confused real findings with outlandish claims within the context of being a powerful person in the Soviet State. Vernalization has been recognized for a while: plants can learn to know when winter is passed and they can start growing. Lysenko exploited this by chilling seeds to make fall crops grow in the spring. One theory as to how they do this is epigenetics --- where certain sequences of DNA are turned on and off by environmental signals. Sometimes these can be passed acrosss generations too. Also covers the training of pea plants to choose a path following air flow towards light.},

% Which of course recalls Action Park and their loop-de-loop slide, with a plan drawn on a napkin. The difference, and it's critical, being that Action Park was just operating back in the days where amateur-design and adventurous entertainment weren't _necessarily_ about cost-cutting, but about the spirit of experimentation. Like kids jumping off a roof into a backyard pool. There's something fun about taking risks.  
% Here though, the park took risks to save money and get to promotion quickly. The spirit of adventurous risk-taking is lost if the _impression_ of professionalism, and engineering design is put forward. Then it's just criminal. ...not that Action Park wasn't criminal too - just in a more innocent, bygone way. Maybe?

This is based on work by Kim Rossmo called "Geographic Profiling" which reveals all sorts of statistical likelihoods demonstrated in criminal behavior.},

  comment={An in-depth look at how cyber tools stolen by The Shadow Brokers from the NSA have been used, and have shaken morale and confidence at the agency. Edward Snowden's release got a lot more media coverage but The Shadow Brokers have released actual code and tools developed by the US and can be used against the US and other targets. Those tools were created at a huge expense to American tax payers and are noe being used by North Korea and Russia against the US and its allies. Millions of people have already been affected, even hospitals have been shut down. More attacks are likely. The US government has to explain to its close allies and business leaders how weapons they developed are being used against them. ``The leaks have renewed a debate over whether the N.S.A. should be permitted to stockpile vulnerabilities it discovers in commercial software to use for spying — rather than immediately alert software makers so the holes can be plugged. The agency claims it has shared with the industry more than 90 percent of flaws it has found, reserving only the most valuable for its own hackers. But if it can’t keep those from leaking, as the last year has demonstrated, the resulting damage to businesses and ordinary computer users around the world can be colossal.''},

It may look like the family-of-man idea that had been sold to the unfortunate over the centuries, to discourage them from complaining that they hadn’t got a very good seat at the family table. In particular, it may seem directly opposed to the identity politics that many have now embraced, in order to end those injustices. They are not part of the family of man, they say. They are part of the family of women or African-Americans or gay people, and never mind individualism and case-by-case judgment. But Schor believes that it is precisely this division—the great political quarrel of our time—that Esperanto may be able to heal, by reconnecting us, through a common language, to a shared earth.''},

The Disney developers had to clear orange groves left over from those missions'' ``The tunnels represent ground level. Everything else is built on top. Disney World is a giant mound, one of the greatest ever constructed in North America. When you’re walking around in the park, you’re about 15 feet above where construction began.  An importance of these tunnels for Disney was that he could keep the costumed characters invisible, when they weren’t “on.” He didn’t ever want the children to see Pluto, for instance, slouching back from his shift to a break room. So at Disney World, the characters pop up where they’re needed, then disappear.'' `` There is something unnatural or I should say unearthly about Lil’ Dog’s weight, or his density. It was like carrying a meteorite. To carry both girls would have been easier.'' ``We were watching the people. That’s what you do at Disney World, mostly. Above and beyond all else, it’s a place where people look at other people (the lines and the endless walking and the crowded feed stations) to reaffirm the fact that we are there together, that the value of the place is such, it has been worth traveling to from all over the world. I couldn’t tell what we made of one another, in the looking. When Disney World was built, it embodied a shared idea of America as pure capitalist fantasy. It’s no longer communicating that idea; the idea is no longer intelligible. I don’t know what it’s communicating. The old virtues are gone, the new ones unidentifiable.'' ``Unfortunately the pictures were entirely of women’s bottoms.

We invented a new cutting technology that reduces waste of the primary raw material and gave the technology to a random subset of producers. Despite the arguably unambiguous net benefits of the technology for nearly all firms, after 15 months take-up remained puzzlingly low. We hypothesize that an important reason for the lack of adoption is a misalignment of incentives within firms: the key employees (cutters and printers) are typically paid piece rates, with no incentive to reduce waste, and the new technology slows them down, at least initially. Fearing reductions in their effective wage, employees resist adoption in various ways, including by misinforming owners about the value of the technology. To investigate this hypothesis, we implemented a second experiment among the firms that originally received the technology: we offered one cutter and one printer per firm a lump-sum payment, approximately equal to a monthly wage, conditional on them demonstrating competence in using the technology in the presence of the owner. This incentive payment, small from the point of view of the firm, had a significant positive effect on adoption. We interpret the results as supportive of the hypothesis that misalignment of incentives within firms is an important barrier to technology adoption in our setting.},

% The fucked up thing here is that workers didn't want to adopt a work pattern that was slower because it would affect their ability to earn from their piece work. But then offered a lump-sum payment they were willing to adopt the slower process. In the summary I don't see an analysis about how long the lump-sum payment would outlast their lost earnings from slower work. Effectively you could consider the lump-sum payment a short-term bribe to accept less money long-term.

% But, it's possible, that in a place like NYC, where the density means census tracts mihgt be a single block, the city is actually MORE diverse than what you would know by looking at Census tracts.

Fairfax argues that grand juries are specifically designed as a check on the prosecutorial powers of government. Like a 4th brach of government (grand juries predate the constitution.) He argues that it is actually the responsibility and function of grand juries to use their discretion to weigh cases beyond just probable cause. Supporting this, he outlines how elected officials, cops, prosecutors, and judges all have vast discretionary powers (they choose whether a case moves forward or not) and therefore it is right that the people represented by the grand jury do as well.},
