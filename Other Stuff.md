  title={Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories},  
  author={Dahl, R.},  
  url={https://books.google.com/books?id=AMpdrgEACAAJ},  
  year={1983},  
  publisher={Farrar, Straus, Giroux},  
  comment={Roald Dahl read hundreds of ghost stories and selected his favorites (mostly from the first half of the 20th Century) for this collection.},  
  category={Other Stuff, ghost stories}  
}  
% The introduction is interesting. He says most ghost stories are awful. And then he starts finding good ones and realizes they are all by women. He uses this as a jumping off point for arguing that children's books are the hardest books to write -- and most good ones are written by women. He argues that the best children's books are far more widely read and read by more generations (after generation) of people than even the best adult novels. Having got that out of the way, he does say he finally found a few good ghost stories written by men.  
% He also says in the introduction that this collection was supposed to be turned into a TV series. But the pilot (The Hanging of Alfred Wadham) was never picked up.

But the article then delves deeply in philosophical meaning of dreams, including the idea that dreams represent access to an incredibly, irrepressibly creatively active part of our mind that is always there, but usually on the leash. So much so that even art from dreams seems dull and static compared to the dreams themselves as revealed in the hypnogogia phase. Also talks about how it seems vaguely possible to influence deeper stages of dreaming, but (as outlined in the deeply profound last few paragraphs) really the wild creative energy of dreams chooses on its own what to accept as fodder from our concious lives and runs with it -- like leaving a sacrifice on an altar to a god.},

  category={Politics, Other Stuff, superscience, ai}  
}  
% The Times writes this story as if this presages the future of warfare. But the real lesson is an old one: well-funded states can pull off nearly-unbelievable operations with sci-fi qualities if they have enough reason to do it.  
% Reading between the details, what you learn is that this was a _very_ specific circumstance: if the guy had ridden in the back seat of an armored car like most top officials, it woud not have been possible. In other words, old-school protections would have vastly outperformed fancy modern techniques. That does not seem like it will change any time soon.  
% Also, the article makes it sound like putting a 1-ton machine gun in place is easier than just flying in a drone. This is clearly not true, and in most cases governments will surely fall back to the far simpler operation of using a drone.  
% What this really is is just the modern equivalent to the old Casto exploding cigar or operation Azorian: it's crazy stuff, and a good story, but in the long run will remain an extremely marginal (and complex, and expensive) option compared to people who want to kill the traditional way with an AK-47 blasting lead everywhere.

@book{fort1919book,  
  title={The Book of the Damned: By Charles Fort},  
  author={Fort, C.},  
  url={https://books.google.com/books?id=lW1HAAAAIAAJ},  
  year={1919},  
  publisher={H. Liveright}  
  comment={Fort's classic work. Written in an impenetrable style that waffles between serious critique of science, self deprecation, and documentation of the phenomenologial, it had moments of brilliance interspersed with long sections of incoherence.},  
  category={Other Stuff, Criticality, science fiction, superscience, science fact, scientific positivism}  
}
% Wikipedia quotes Colin Wilson as sayging: "Expressed in a sentence, Fort's principle goes something like this: People with a psychological need to believe in marvels are no more prejudiced and gullible than people with a psychological need not to believe in marvels."
% Chapter 4 contains this amazing line: "I think, myself, that it would be absurd to say that the whole sky is gelatinous: it seems more acceptable that only certain areas are."
% While this book has the same base-level incoherency of any cult-founding document, I can identify with the pseudo-skepticism (for that's what it is --- not pseudo-science, but pseudo-skepticism) that underlies Fort's thinking. After all, it is only a few years after this book is published that Hubble would prove that there are galaxies beyond the Milky Way, and thus infinitely expand the size of the universe as we know it. For a person living today, science is regarded as foundational. The details might change, but the underlying core is solid. This is accepted as one major cultural pillar of our times. And yet, even now, it is so easy to point to how much science gets wrong, even at very very basic levels. (See Most Research Findings are False.) Imagine living in Fort's time 100 years ago. At that point good science was so mixed with bad science that it must not have been clear at _all_ that a positivist approach to science would actually yield any productive outcomes.
% Fort mentions ancient Chinese seals found in Ireland. See: \url{https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3vypa3/since_1780_more_than_60_chinese_porcelain_seals/}
% One idea of Fort's that I really like is his conception that most of the unexplained phenomenon of the world might have got there because the Earth passes through a part of space that is littered with the detritus of some higher culture. He compares himself to a deep-sea fish hit on the nose with a plate of steel that feel from somewhere above.
% Towards the end of the book he documents indcidents that are uncannily similar to modern day UFO observations. See particularly Chapter 22 (with drawing), Chapters 24 and 25 for dirigibles in the sky, and 26 for lights in the sky.

% page 70 - Jerry Brown refused to live in the governors mansion Ronald Reagan built, living in an apartment instead. In his later life as governor, he moved back into the old mansion that Reagan and others had abandoned. Didion points out it has a marble counter top - which people on her 1977 tour didn't know what it was for.

Lysenko exploited this by chilling seeds to make fall crops grow in the spring.

The difference, and it's critical, being that Action Park was just operating back in the days where amateur-design and adventurous entertainment weren't _necessarily_ about cost-cutting, but about the spirit of experimentation. Like kids jumping off a roof into a backyard pool. There's something fun about taking risks.  
% Here though, the park took risks to save money and get to promotion quickly. The spirit of adventurous risk-taking is lost if the _impression_ of professionalism, and engineering design is put forward. Then it's just criminal. ...not that Action Park wasn't criminal too - just in a more innocent, bygone way. Maybe?

Edward Snowden's release got a lot more media coverage but The Shadow Brokers have released actual code and tools developed by the US and can be used against the US and other targets. Those tools were created at a huge expense to American tax payers and are noe being used by North Korea and Russia against the US and its allies. Millions of people have already been affected, even hospitals have been shut down. More attacks are likely. The US government has to explain to its close allies and business leaders how weapons they developed are being used against them. ``The leaks have renewed a debate over whether the N.S.A. should be permitted to stockpile vulnerabilities it discovers in commercial software to use for spying — rather than immediately alert software makers so the holes can be plugged. The agency claims it has shared with the industry more than 90 percent of flaws it has found, reserving only the most valuable for its own hackers. But if it can’t keep those from leaking, as the last year has demonstrated, the resulting damage to businesses and ordinary computer users around the world can be colossal.''},

In particular, it may seem directly opposed to the identity politics that many have now embraced, in order to end those injustices. They are not part of the family of man, they say. They are part of the family of women or African-Americans or gay people, and never mind individualism and case-by-case judgment.

But since Florida thought it was going to be a city with residents, it granted Disney complete control over all aspects of the development. ``All on the soil where the very first North American utopias, the forgotten Franciscan missions of Spanish Florida, had been destroyed, when the South Carolina colonists burned them at the start of the 18th century, murdering their priests and enslaving their Native American populations. The Disney developers had to clear orange groves left over from those missions'' ``The tunnels represent ground level. Everything else is built on top. Disney World is a giant mound, one of the greatest ever constructed in North America. When you’re walking around in the park, you’re about 15 feet above where construction began.  An importance of these tunnels for Disney was that he could keep the costumed characters invisible, when they weren’t “on.” He didn’t ever want the children to see Pluto, for instance, slouching back from his shift to a break room. So at Disney World, the characters pop up where they’re needed, then disappear.'' `` There is something unnatural or I should say unearthly about Lil’ Dog’s weight, or his density. It was like carrying a meteorite. To carry both girls would have been easier.'' ``We were watching the people. That’s what you do at Disney World, mostly. Above and beyond all else, it’s a place where people look at other people (the lines and the endless walking and the crowded feed stations) to reaffirm the fact that we are there together, that the value of the place is such, it has been worth traveling to from all over the world. I couldn’t tell what we made of one another, in the looking. When Disney World was built, it embodied a shared idea of America as pure capitalist fantasy. It’s no longer communicating that idea; the idea is no longer intelligible. I don’t know what it’s communicating. The old virtues are gone, the new ones unidentifiable.'' ``Unfortunately the pictures were entirely of women’s bottoms. It wasn’t “nice” or shapely bottoms that Lucho had been after, but gigantically obese ones. They’ve never seen people who look like us, most places in the world.''},

 abstract = {This paper studies technology adoption in a cluster of soccer-ball producers in Sialkot, Pakistan. We invented a new cutting technology that reduces waste of the primary raw material and gave the technology to a random subset of producers. Despite the arguably unambiguous net benefits of the technology for nearly all firms, after 15 months take-up remained puzzlingly low. We hypothesize that an important reason for the lack of adoption is a misalignment of incentives within firms: the key employees (cutters and printers) are typically paid piece rates, with no incentive to reduce waste, and the new technology slows them down, at least initially. Fearing reductions in their effective wage, employees resist adoption in various ways, including by misinforming owners about the value of the technology. To investigate this hypothesis, we implemented a second experiment among the firms that originally received the technology: we offered one cutter and one printer per firm a lump-sum payment, approximately equal to a monthly wage, conditional on them demonstrating competence in using the technology in the presence of the owner. This incentive payment, small from the point of view of the firm, had a significant positive effect on adoption. We interpret the results as supportive of the hypothesis that misalignment of incentives within firms is an important barrier to technology adoption in our setting.},

% The fucked up thing here is that workers didn't want to adopt a work pattern that was slower because it would affect their ability to earn from their piece work. But then offered a lump-sum payment they were willing to adopt the slower process. In the summary I don't see an analysis about how long the lump-sum payment would outlast their lost earnings from slower work. Effectively you could consider the lump-sum payment a short-term bribe to accept less money long-term.
