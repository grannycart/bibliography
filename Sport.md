  comment={Professional tennis players often reach a point of break down and sometimes quit the sport. This is from the grueling long hours and days, the repetition, the lack of change of environment while stuck on a court every day, the lack of interaction with other people, and the sheer the lonliness of playing tennis.},

  comment={Transfermarkt is a website that gathers data on statistics about soccer players, and then uses that data to create a market value for individual players. This number is used by everyone, but especially team administration when they are discussing trading and contracts with players. The interesting part is that at its core is a combination of input from soccer fans and judgement by a team of experts at the company to arrive at the market value. It is _not_ based on strict data, but rather has human judgement at the heart of it. And it has become critical to the world of soccer because it offers all these people --- with millions of dollars at stake every time --- a concrete point to work from, even if the source is grounded in subjectivity.},

  comment={In golf, the sudden onset of shaking hands and an inability to put, often among expert golfers, is called the yips. Traditionally it was thought of as a mental block, but in this article an analyst suggests it might be caused purely by a physical problem - scar tissue in muscles from repeatedly swining the driver in a specific way. Others debate this, and claim it is purely physical, or a combination of problems, pointing out that some golfers recover miraculously and all of a sudden.},

  comment={It turns out that because it is a smoother less complex motion, the underhanded "granny" throw is more accurate in basketball than the standard overhand throw. But nobody does it simply because they think it looks dumb. The people who look deeply at this stuff actually say the underhand it about even with an overhand throw for accuracy if both are fully developed to the most potential of a player. But any player who doesn't throw overhand shots well, should consider the underhand because it's easier to master. Not mentioned: the obvious fact that this basically only applies to free throws, which are undefended, rather than active play throws where you have to get around a defender.},

  category={Sport, baseball}  
}  
% This article shows interesting implications for the generalist vs specialist arguments, or for complaints about the hyper-professionalism of the culture.  
% It would also be great to see the terms "showcase" "showcase skills" or "showcasing" get adopted by the general public, and mean both that someone has serious showy skills, but also implies that their non-show skills might be weak. And thus they might have only a niche role to play in an organization or effot.

  comment={A fun story about the early history of diving, technology that was spurred, of course, in the effort to reclaim sunken treasure. Highlights include the sinking of the Royal George, and the dive to demine the channel of Sevastopol during the Crimean War.},  
  category={Sport, diving, history, shipwrecks, crimean war}  
}  
% Actual date unspecified.  
% This is written in a kind of delightful Reader's Digest accessible style.  
% "Most of the injuries were a function of pressure, a phenomenon poorly understood at the time. Those in watertight diving suits connected with air hoses suffered from the worst injury, a condition called squeeze."  
% "At 40 feet, their face would engorge with blood. The blood vessels in their eyes would burst and bodily fluids would shoot from their orifices. Then they would hear a sickening swish at the back of the dive helmet—this was the sound of their hair being sucked off their scalp. At extreme depths, their face would rip from their head and be deposited back through the air hose on deck in a bloody spurt."  
% This story reminds us that underwater is really no environment for humans.  
% I've had the thought before that while many enviornments on earth, even the far north, are places humans can adapt to living, underwater, the antarctic, and space are all environments that are so far outside our safe experience that they can only be ventured into with support from other places.  
% There's something deeply disturbing and frightening about that, if you ask me. And that is something that I feel like 18th (and probably 19th Century) people inherently felt, but now is completely gone.  
% Now diving is seen as just a fun sport. People don't take into account the insane risk involved.  
% A funny thing to think about, especially in terms of Mars exploration, is that in modern times no human population has ever moved into a new environment and become self-sustaining in that environment. There are no space colonies that are producing their own food and supplies and living their sustainably. There's no undersea colonies or even Antarctic colonies either. (The Antarctic colonies, of course, entirely depend on shipments from the mainland, and produce nothing that could even be traded economically for those shipments. So it's not like they even have ECONOMIC independence, much less phsyical life-sustaining independence.)

% I like that this challenges the notion that activities for elites like violn should merit a degree while activities for the masses like sports should not.  
% However, I think this is just the start of a proposal. To do it would require figuring out a way to tie the sport degree in deeply with academics. And it would be preferable if the corrolary to that were that funding the comes in from sports could be redistributed to less-well funded but more sorely needed academic programs.

There wasn’t the slightest hint that Wolfe was considering resigning — until the football players got involved.

% Once again it is shown: protesting does little or nothing (except possibly raise awareness). People in power only fear economic repercussions or violence. And since the left wing abhors violence, we are left only with the occasional football player to change things.

% Where a political science researcher talks about finding that the easier it is to do an action, the less representatives are affected by it.  
% So since it is easy to put a protest together now, it gets less attention. Same for emails or phone calls. There is diminishing returns to ENCOURAGING people to call their representatives.  
% It is still hard to get people to show up at representative's office though...  
% And suggested in here is that taking the risk of violent action is something that REALLY gets attention  
% because it is a hard thing to get people to do.  
% Though this feels a little like she's talking out both sides of her mouth:  
% It's too easy to get people to show up for marches, so those don't work,  
% But it's too hard to get people to show up at rep's offices, so those do?  
% Seems like both of those are about the same lift for people to me.  
% I think really what happens is reps are human and get fatigued and numbed to things they see all the time.
