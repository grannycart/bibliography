## Key to entries
@article{uniqueidentifier,  
  Author={Last, First and Last, First},  
  url={http://www.example.com},  
  Title={Title pasted from Article},  
  journal={Publication name},  
  date={2020-07-dd},  
  comment={This is a description of the article, and sometimes some thoughts and or comments that I might also have about the article.},  
  category={From the topics list above, plus whatever other categories I made up that I feel like the article belongs to. Comma separated, lowercase.}  
}  
% Further comments start with % because that's how latex does it. (Though I think bibtex doesn't actually require a % for a comment between entries.)
 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Why this formatting
Because it lets me pull the entries as bibtex. Long-term viability, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## A caveat
Most notes in these entries were drafted without revision, or
potentially even very much thought. They may be rough, nonsensical,
unfinished, stupid, or offensive. They are only intended to remind
myself of ideas any particular article may have spawned for me. They
should not be understood as reflective of any particular opinion or
value of mine or anyone else's.
