  Title={The Great Grocery Squeeze},  
  journal={The Atlantic},  
  date={2024-12-06},  
  comment={The history of the Robinson-Patman Act, which was implemented in the 1930s to prevent large grocery stores from using their size to demand cheaper prices from suppliers, large and small businesses had to be sold to at the same price --- it evened the playing field (though still allowed that items that could legitimately be sold cheaper in bulk still could be). The core of this act was dismantled by the Reagan administration, directly leading to the rise of food deserts (no grocery store for more than 10 miles in rural areas, and no grocery store within a mile in low-income areas). The problem of food deserts cannot be fixed without repairing this regulation.},  
  category={Health, Urbanism, Criticality, Economics}  
}  
% Super interesting in that this is even bigger than just grocery stores. It seems like regulating price pressure by large stores is _critical_ to healthy competition in any industry, especially for keeping small businesses healthy. Yet, the Reagan era administrators dismantled Robinson-Patman because they argued it went against "economic literacy" --- and I'm sure they had the highly-regarded economists who would back this up for them.  
% Also, I'm still skeptical about food deserts in NYC. I think the way grocery stores are measured is completely broken and ignores many many small grocery shops that DO operate effectively in low-income areas selling immmigrant-specific foods --- think of Flatbush Farms.

  Title={Covid Shots for Children},  
  journal={The New York Times},  
  date={2024-02-13},  
  comment={The US is one of the few countries that urges covid vaccines and boosters for children 6 months and older.

  category={Health, Criticality, covid}  
}  
% This is interesting because of the public health implications. Even if you believe the benefits outweighed the risks, the recommendation by the CDC is not working as most Americans are choosing to not booster their children. In addition this is contributing to the lack of trust in the CDC and public health.  
% "During the pandemic, as Galea told me, health experts sometimes adopted “an illiberal ideology.” This ideology imagined people as robots who existed merely to minimize the chances of contracting a virus."

% I suggest that this may apply to adult anxiety too. We think of adults as independent by defininition, but that simply isn't true.

  date={2023-08-16},  
  comment={Life expectancy in the US is lower than any other rich nation. Some demographic groups have life expectancies lower than the poorest countries on Earth, particularly among men. Meanwhile rich white men in the US have among the highest life expectancies in the world. Yet Hispanic people lack health insurance at high rates, but have longer life expectancies than white people. Kristof calls for changes to individual behaviors as well as societal fixes like expanding Medicaid, extending the child tax credit, and providing drug treatment.},  
  category={Health, Criticality, life expectancy, health care system}  
}  
% Kristof's solution seems to be largely to tackle the low-hanging fruit of expanding Medicaid and the like, with a small dash of personal responsibility for bad behaviors thrown in. But the most interesting part of this piece is the Hispanic paradox. It _stronly_ suggests that both personal responsibility and access to health care are just small treatments to the symptom of the problem, not dealing with the actual _cause_.  
% The Hispanic paradox suggests that the cause of our health care problems is largely _cultural_ --- Americans are isolated and simply don't care about others in their communities. To some extent calling for an expansion of Medicaid is like saying "let the government deal with those people in the community that I don't personally care about." (This is hardly _Christian_.) It seems like what we really need to learn from the Hispanic "paradox" (it's only a paradox if you are assuming that access to health care is actually a good thing for you) is that the MOST healthy thing you can do is be a part of strong community ties --- and _notably_, (I think) that being part of a strong community can be done without decreasing your machismo. (This is nearly unmentioned in this piece, but I think if you are talking about the health of men, I don't see how you can not make it front and center.)  
% The _real_ solution to the health crisis is to make sure everyone has four things: community (includes family, but not exclusive to family -- even a reculse in a mountain hut should feel like they have a particular role in a community), dignity (primarily in the form of a job that pays well enough to live on and comes with no small portion of respect), diet, and exercise.

Nebulous symptoms like this have been around for many years, almost always affecting middle-aged/middle class women. This is not to suggest that the patient needs to "just get over it" but that the best treatments are psychiatric: namely Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Graded Exercise Therapy (slowly increasing exercise). However, there is a huge public backlash against the idea that it is a mental disorder by people insisting the symptoms are biological, despite the fact that scientific evidence keeps piling up for a mental cause.

% I've always said that planners could learn a lot from marketing. And this approach to covid vaccines shows how that could be true. On the other hand, despite the argument that these marketing methods can ignore traditional demographics, clearly the "cost-anxious" are going to be in the traditional demographic category of low-income. And even the copy here acknowledges that most members of system distrusters are people of color. In addition, all of these groups are associated with the traditional demographics category of having a distinct geography. So it's possible the marketers have mostly just created different (and much cheesier) labels to get at the same ideas.

  comment={80 percent of personal trainers still recommend stretching as a regular part of people's workouts. Flexibility is still considered one of the five "major components" of physical fitness, alongside body composition, cardiovascular endurance, muscle endurance, and muscle strength. In reality, studies have repeatedly shown that flexibility does nothing for one's health and it does not improve one's sports performance (unless you are a gymnast). It is also not related to non-sports problems like lower back pain. Stretching before, during, or after a workout does nothing to prevent muscle soreness or reduce injury. In fact, there is evidence that holding a stretch DECREASES strength and speed for up to an hour. For some folks who like being flexibile, there's probably little harm in it. But there is no way it is related to overall health.},

  journal={Scientific American},  
  date={2020-02-12},  
  comment={Despite a quarte of a trillion dollars spent since Nixon declared a 'war on cancer' in 1971, and all the hype surrounding cancer research and science, 600,000 people still die every year of the disease. Adjusting for aging populations (that is, putting cancer healthcare in a more favorable light because more people are living longer to die of cancer) mortality rates from cancer have declined 30 percent since 1991. But 1991 follows 60 years of _increases_ --- the current mortality rate for all cancers is just under what it was in _1930_. The increases came with the increase in smoking. The fall came with the reduction of smoking. We are simply back to where we started, in terms of mortality numbers. "without reductions in smoking there would have been virtually no reduction in overall cancer mortality in either men or women since the early 1990s." "Clinical cancer trials have the highest failure rate compared with other therapeutic areas," "72 new anticancer drugs approved by the FDA between 2004 and 2014 prolonged survival for an average of 2.1 months. A 2017 report concluded that most cancer drug approvals have not been shown to, or do not, improve clinically relevant end points, including survival and quality of life. The authors worried that the FDA may be approving many costly, toxic drugs that do not improve overall survival.”  "A 2015 meta-analysis by epidemiologist John Ioannidis (renowned for bringing the scientific replication crisis to light) and others found no reductions in all-cause mortality from tests for cancer of the breast, prostate, colon, lung, cervix, mouth or ovaries for asymptomatic patients." "Studies of tests for a specific cancer generally look at mortality attributed to that cancer. Mammograms are thus deemed effective if women who get mammograms die less often from breast cancer than women who do not get mammograms. This method can overstate the benefits of tests, because it might omit deaths resulting, directly or indirectly, from the diagnosis. After all, surgery, chemotherapy and radiation can have devastating iatrogenic effects, including heart disease, opportunistic infections, other forms of cancer and suicide."  "A 2015 analysis points out, in general people do not live longer as a result of early detection. They simply live longer with a diagnosis of cancer, with all its harmful emotional, economic and physiological consequences." Solution: "In “The Case for Being a Medical Conservative," a manifesto published last year, four physicians (including the aforementioned Vinay Prasad) urge colleagues to recognize the human body’s “inherent healing properties" and to acknowledge “how little effect the clinician has on outcomes.” Physicians will thus protect themselves “against our greatest foe—hubris.”},

Using bunching techniques, we estimate that the policy reduced affected patients’ wait times by 19 minutes, yet distorted a number of medical decisions. In response to the policy, doctors increased the intensity of ED treatment and admitted more patients for costly inpatient care. We also find a striking 14% reduction in mortality. To determine the mechanism behind these health improvements, we exploit heterogeneity in patient severity and hospital crowding, and find strongly suggestive evidence that it is the reduced wait times, rather than the additional admits, that saves lives. Overall we conclude that, despite distorting medical decisions, constraining ED doctors can induce cost-effective reductions in mortality.},

PURPOSE: The present cross-sectional study (n = 37,570) examined the associations of driving time with a series of health behaviors and outcomes in a large population sample of middle-aged and older adults using data from the Social, Economic, and Environmental Factor Study conducted in New South Wales, Australia, in 2010. METHODS: Multiple logistic regression was used in 2013 to examine the associations of usual daily driving time with health-related behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep) and outcomes (obesity, general health, quality of life, psychological distress, time stress, social functioning), adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Findings suggested that longer driving time was associated with higher odds for smoking, insufficient physical activity, short sleep, obesity, and worse physical and mental health. The associations consistently showed a dose-response pattern and more than 120 minutes of driving per day had the strongest and most consistent associations with the majority of outcomes. CONCLUSION: This study highlights driving as a potential lifestyle risk factor for public health. More population-level multidisciplinary research is needed to understand the mechanism of how driving affects health.},

  comment={In the United States, almost 4,000 persons die from drowning each year. Drowning is responsible for more deaths among children aged 1–4 years than any other cause except congenital anomalies. For persons aged ≤29 years, drowning is one of the top three causes of unintentional injury death. Previous research has identified racial/ethnic disparities in drowning rates. To describe these differences by age of decedent and drowning setting, CDC analyzed 12 years of combined mortality data from 1999–2010 for those aged ≤29 years. Among non-Hispanics, the overall drowning rate for American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) was twice the rate for whites, and the rate for blacks was 1.4 times the rate for whites. Disparities were greatest in swimming pools, with swimming pool drowning rates among blacks aged 5–19 years 5.5 times higher than those among whites in the same age group. This disparity was greatest at ages 11–12 years; at these ages, blacks drown in swimming pools at 10 times the rate of whites. Drowning prevention strategies include using barriers (e.g., fencing) and life jackets, actively supervising or lifeguarding, teaching basic swimming skills and performing bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The practicality and effectiveness of these strategies varies by setting; however, basic swimming skills can be beneficial across all settings.},

A field experiment provides causal evidence that working adults report greater happiness after spending money on a time-saving purchase than on a material purchase. Together, these results suggest that using money to buy time can protect people from the detrimental effects of time pressure on life satisfaction.},

abstract = {Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a salt form of a non-essential amino acid commonly used as a food additive for its unique flavour enhancing qualities. Since the first description of the ‘Monosodium glutamate symptom complex’, originally described in 1968 as the ‘Chinese restaurant syndrome’, a number of anecdotal reports and small clinical studies of variable quality have attributed a variety of symptoms to the dietary ingestion of MSG. Descriptions of MSG-induced asthma, urticaria, angio-oedema, and rhinitis have prompted some to suggest that MSG should be an aetiologic consideration in patients presenting with these conditions. This review prevents a critical review of the available literature related to the possible role of MSG in the so-called ‘Chinese restaurant syndrome’ and in eliciting asthmatic bronchospasm, urticaria, angio-oedema, and rhinitis. Despite concerns raised by early reports, decades of research have failed to demonstrate a clear and consistent relationship between MSG ingestion and the development of these conditions.},

abstract = { Aims:To review the burden of allergic and infectious diseases and the evidence for a link to microbial exposure, the human microbiome and immune system, and to assess whether we could develop lifestyles which reconnect us with exposures which could reduce the risk of allergic disease while also protecting against infectious disease.Methods:Using methodology based on the Delphi technique, six experts in infectious and allergic disease were surveyed to allow for elicitation of group judgement and consensus view on issues pertinent to the aim.Results:Key themes emerged where evidence shows that interaction with microbes that inhabit the natural environment and human microbiome plays an essential role in immune regulation. Changes in lifestyle and environmental exposure, rapid urbanisation, altered diet and antibiotic use have had profound effects on the human microbiome, leading to failure of immunotolerance and increased risk of allergic disease. Although evidence supports the concept of immune regulation driven by microbe–host interactions, the term ‘hygiene hypothesis’ is a misleading misnomer. There is no good evidence that hygiene, as the public understands, is responsible for the clinically relevant changes to microbial exposures.Conclusion:Evidence suggests a combination of strategies, including natural childbirth, breast feeding, increased social exposure through sport, other outdoor activities, less time spent indoors, diet and appropriate antibiotic use, may help restore the microbiome and perhaps reduce risks of allergic disease. Preventive efforts must focus on early life. The term ‘hygiene hypothesis’ must be abandoned. Promotion of a risk assessment approach (targeted hygiene) provides a framework for maximising protection against pathogen exposure while allowing spread of essential microbes between family members. To build on these findings, we must change public, public health and professional perceptions about the microbiome and about hygiene. We need to restore public understanding of hygiene as a means to prevent infectious disease. },

category={Health, hygiene hypothesis, Criticality}  
}  
% This explainer about autoimmute disease from the Washington Post describes the hygiene hyphothesis as "and older theory" now. It also makes a distinction between the "hygiene hypothessis" as being about the decline of infectious diseases and a rise in antibiotic use, while more modern thinking is that it's about exposure to day-to-day microbes rather than true infectous pathogens. (And this is not considered "the Hygiene Hypothesis" --- I think I was conflating those things in the past.) Most of the factors now suspected in the rise of auto-immune disease are things like ultra-processed food, air pollution, gut health, and stress. So individual action like not washing your hands probably doesn't help.

Secondary outcomes were adverse effects, patient adherence, and use of rescue medication. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability). We calculated weighted mean differences or risk ratios and 95\% confidence intervals using a random effects model. The Cochrane Collaboration{\textquoteright}s tool was used for assessing risk of bias, and the GRADE approach was used to evaluate the quality of evidence and summarise conclusions.Results 12 reports (13 randomised trials) were included. There was {\textquotedblleft}high quality{\textquotedblright} evidence that paracetamol is ineffective for reducing pain intensity (weighted mean difference -0.5, 95\% confidence interval -2.9 to 1.9) and disability (0.4, -1.7 to 2.5) or improving quality of life (0.4, -0.9 to 1.7) in the short term in people with low back pain.

hip or knee osteoarthritis there was {\textquotedblleft}high quality{\textquotedblright} evidence that paracetamol provides a significant, although not clinically important, effect on pain (-3.7, -5.5 to -1.9) and disability (-2.9, -4.9 to -0.9) in the short term. The number of patients reporting any adverse event (risk ratio 1.0, 95\% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.1), any serious adverse event (1.2, 0.7 to 2.1), or withdrawn from the study because of adverse events (1.2, 0.9 to 1.5) was similar in the paracetamol and placebo groups. Patient adherence to treatment (1.0, 0.9 to 1.1) and use of rescue medication (0.7, 0.4 to 1.3) was also similar between groups. {\textquotedblleft}High quality{\textquotedblright} evidence showed that patients taking paracetamol are nearly four times more likely to have abnormal results on liver function tests (3.8, 1.9 to 7.4), but the clinical importance of this effect is uncertain.Conclusions Paracetamol is ineffective in the treatment of low back pain and provides minimal short term benefit for people with osteoarthritis.

% This article describes the concept of the "default-mode network" which is, I believe what I call daydreaming, letting one's mind wander. This is in contrast to being on task or "flow". Meditation (and ayahuasca) are about shutting down both of those modes and tapping a different consciousness. Which I am sure is important to our mental health.   
(Though I strongly suspect that meditiation is far less necessary if people got more and better sleep. Think about it - meditation frees you to connect to your subconscious, but while awake, to try and make connections and achieve deeper realizations about your life. Is this not exactly what sleep scientists think sleep does?)  
I'm not so much interested in the point where you shut down daydreaming and task orientation both. I'm interested in the point where those two things intersect. For example, daydreaming is very strong while riding my bicycle, but then when I sit down to write about my daydreaming thoughts, (in task/flow mode) I often lose critical details. Is it possible that the reason so many great writers and creators were doing drugs has less to do with tapping subconscious, and more to do with connecting daydreaming to flow? If you are on heroine, maybe it allows you to be in task mode AND daydream at the same time. Or connects the two together into one.  
How could I achieve that? Heroine, maybe. But perhaps it's the ability to record thoughts while in daydream mode? (A tape recorder on a bicycle?) Or a space where you can be in task mode, writing, but stand up and walk in daydream mode?

  comment = {A long-form article about the history of the nutrition science studying dietary guidelines for sugar versus fat intake. Discusses how science is not a process of convincing people of empirical evidence but in fact a political process. The nutritionists of the 1960s and 1970s lampooned a mild-natured scientist named John Yudkin for saying sugar was what made people fat. ``We tend to think of heretics as contrarians, individuals with a compulsion to flout conventional wisdom. But sometimes a heretic is simply a mainstream thinker who stays facing the same way while everyone around him turns 180 degrees.'' ``In a 2015 paper titled Does Science Advance One Funeral at a Time?, a team of scholars at the National Bureau of Economic Research sought an empirical basis for a remark made by the physicist Max Planck: “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”'' ``A scientist is part of what the Polish philosopher of science Ludwik Fleck called a “thought collective”: a group of people exchanging ideas in a mutually comprehensible idiom. The group, suggested Fleck, inevitably develops a mind of its own, as the individuals in it converge on a way of communicating, thinking and feeling.  This makes scientific inquiry prone to the eternal rules of human social life: deference to the charismatic, herding towards majority opinion, punishment for deviance, and intense discomfort with admitting to error. Of course, such tendencies are precisely what the scientific method was invented to correct for, and over the long run, it does a good job of it. In the long run, however, we’re all dead, quite possibly sooner than we would be if we hadn’t been following a diet based on poor advice.''},

Almost half of people earning less than 30,000 a year sleep at least six hours a night, compared with about a third of those earning at least 75,000.'' ``Americans also sleep less than we used to. In 1942, almost 85 percent of us slept at least seven hours a night. Today, less than 60 percent of us do.'' ``Not getting enough sleep is a big problem. Randomized controlled trials show that people who are sleep-deprived can see decreases in their empathy. More than one such study has shown that sleep deprivation can leave people more sensitive to pain. Sleep deprivation can hurt cognition, and it is associated with many, many car accidents.'' ``But serious sleep deprivation in adults is most likely rarer than many think it is\ldots Many news reports that highlight the dangers from too little sleep are assuming that all adults need at least eight hours. There’s just little evidence that’s so.'' (Except for children.) ``A study published in 2014 examined 9,000 students in eight public schools in three states.

The effects of severe national recessions in the United States, appear to have a beneficial effect on mortality that is roughly twice as strong as that predicted due to the elevated unemployment rates alone while the higher predicted rate of suicides during typical periods of economic weakness is approximately offset during severe recessions.

 abstract = {This paper estimates the change in net (of subsidy) financial burden (“the price of responsibility”) and in welfare that would be experienced by a large nationally representative sample of the “non-poor” uninsured if they were to purchase Silver or Bronze plans on the ACA exchanges.  The sample is the set of full-year uninsured persons represented in the Current Population Survey for the pre-ACA period with incomes above 138 percent of the federal poverty level.  The estimated change in financial burden compares out-of-pocket payments by income stratum in the pre-ACA period with the sum of premiums (net of subsidy) and expected  cost sharing (net of subsidy) for benchmark Silver and Bronze plans, under various assumptions about the extent of increased spending associated with obtaining coverage.  In addition to changes in the financial burden, our welfare estimates incorporate the value of additional care consumed and the change in risk premiums for changes in exposure to out-of-pocket payments associated with coverage, under various assumptions about risk aversion.  We find that the average financial burden will increase for all income levels once insured.  Subsidy-eligible persons with incomes below 250 percent of the poverty threshold likely experience welfare improvements that offset the higher financial burden, depending on assumptions about risk aversion and the value of additional consumption of medical care.  However, even under the most optimistic assumptions, close to half of the formerly uninsured (especially those with higher incomes) experience both higher financial burden and lower estimated welfare; indicating a positive “price of responsibility” for complying with the individual mandate.  The percentage of the sample with estimated welfare increases is close to matching observed take-up rates by the previously uninsured in the exchanges.},

  abstract = {In 2011, one in three women who gave birth in the United States did so by cesarean delivery. Cesarean birth can be life-saving for the fetus, the mother, or both in certain cases. However, the rapid increase in cesarean birth rates from 1996 to 2011 without clear evidence of concomitant decreases in maternal or neonatal morbidity or mortality raises significant concern that cesarean delivery is overused. Variation in the rates of nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex cesarean births also indicates that clinical practice patterns affect the number of cesarean births performed. The most common indications for primary cesarean delivery include, in order of frequency, labor dystocia, abnormal or indeterminate (formerly, nonreassuring) fetal heart rate tracing, fetal malpresentation, multiple gestation, and suspected fetal macrosomia. Safe reduction of the rate of primary cesarean deliveries will require different approaches for each of these, as well as other, indications. For example, it may be necessary to revisit the definition of labor dystocia because recent data show that contemporary labor progresses at a rate substantially slower than what was historically taught. Additionally, improved and standardized fetal heart rate interpretation and management may have an effect. Increasing women’s access to nonmedical interventions during labor, such as continuous labor and delivery support, also has been shown to reduce cesarean birth rates. External cephalic version for breech presentation and a trial of labor for women with twin gestations when the first twin is in cephalic presentation are other of several examples of interventions that can contribute to the safe lowering of the primary cesarean delivery rate.},

 abstract = {A large literature has analyzed pricing inefficiencies in health insurance markets due to adverse selection, typically assuming informed, active consumers on the demand side of the market. However, recent evidence suggests that many consumers have information frictions that lead to suboptimal health plan choices. As a result, policies such as information provision, plan recommendations, and smart defaults to improve consumer choices are being implemented in many applied contexts. In this paper we develop a general framework to study insurance market equilibrium and evaluate policy interventions in the presence of choice frictions. Friction-reducing policies can increase welfare by facilitating better matches between consumers and plans, but can decrease welfare by increasing the correlation between willingness-to-pay and costs, exacerbating adverse selection. We identify relationships between the underlying distributions of consumer (i) costs (ii) surplus from risk protection and (iii) choice frictions that determine whether friction-reducing policies will be on net welfare increasing or reducing. We extend the analysis to study how policies to improve consumer choices interact with the supply-side policy of risk-adjustment transfers and show that the effectiveness of the latter policy can have important implications for the effectiveness of the former. We implement the model empirically using proprietary data on insurance choices, utilization, and consumer information from a large firm. We leverage structural estimates from prior work with these data and highlight how the model's micro-foundations can be estimated in practice. In our specific setting, we find that friction-reducing policies exacerbate adverse selection, essentially leading to the market fully unraveling, and reduce welfare. Risk-adjustment transfers are complementary, substantially mitigating the negative impact of friction-reducing policies, but having little effect in their absence.},

This is not to say that racism doesn’t cause poor health, but merely that it does so (in part) through socioeconomic pathways.[6] House argues that we should think about the social determinants of health using the now popular sociological framework of intersectionality, with economic, racial, and gender “axes” together playing a role in the production of health and disease. Indeed, the fact that the socioeconomically advantaged are as healthy as the residents of our peer nations helps buttress the point that, in America, there are indeed two interrelated inequalities at play — one of wealth and income, and the other of health. Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty have outlined the quantitative contours of the former with great clarity, but the latter has received far less attention in the public sphere. And yet, shouldn’t it be the contrary? Isn’t health more fundamental?'' ``The emerging picture, therefore, is not simply that poverty kills, which is true. Nor is it simply that there is a continuous gradient of health by income or education, which is also true. Both of these dynamics have presumably been at work, at least to some extent, in stratified human societies throughout history. The salient point is that within the past few decades, there seems to be a historic widening in the prospects for healthy living between those at the top of the economic pyramid and those below. Societal gains in both health and wealth are confined to those at the top, causing metrics of population health to experience a relative overall deterioration.''},

abstract ={Background—The association between consumption of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and risk of mortality remains inconclusive.  Methods and Results—We examined the associations of consumption of total, caffeinated, and decaffeinated coffee with risk of subsequent total and cause-specific mortality among 74,890 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), 93,054 women in the NHS 2, and 40,557 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Coffee consumption was assessed at baseline using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. During 4,690,072 person-years of follow-up, 19,524 women and 12,432 men died. Consumption of total, caffeinated, and decaffeinated coffee were non-linearly associated with mortality. Compared to non-drinkers, coffee consumption one to five cups/d was associated with lower risk of mortality, while coffee consumption more than five cups/d was not associated with risk of mortality. However, when restricting to never smokers, compared to non-drinkers, the HRs of mortality were 0.94 (0.89 to 0.99) for ≤ 1 cup/d, 0.92 (0.87 to 0.97) for 1.1-3 cups/d, 0.85 (0.79 to 0.92) for 3.1-5 cups/d, and 0.88 (0.78 to 0.99) for > 5 cups/d (p for non-linearity = 0.32; p for trend < 0.001). Significant inverse associations were observed for caffeinated (p for trend < 0.001) and decaffeinated coffee (p for trend = 0.022). Significant inverse associations were observed between coffee consumption and deaths due to cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, and suicide. No significant association between coffee consumption and total cancer mortality was found.  Conclusions—Higher consumption of total coffee, caffeinated coffee, and decaffeinated coffee was associated with lower risk of total mortality. },

Differences in suicides between men and women, between Hispanics, blacks, and whites, between age groups for men, between countries or US states, between calendar years, and between days of the week, do not match differences in life evaluation. By contrast, reports of physical pain are strongly predictive of suicide in many contexts. The prevalence of pain is increasing among middle-aged Americans, and is accompanied by a substantial increase in suicides and deaths from drug and alcohol poisoning. Our measure of pain is now highest in middle age—when life evaluation and positive affect are at a minimum. In the absence of the pain epidemic, suicide and life evaluation are likely unrelated, leaving unresolved whether either one is a useful overall measure of population wellbeing.},

The results suggest that each additional uninsured person costs local hospitals 900 each year in uncompensated care. Similarly, the closure of a nearby hospital increases the uncompensated care costs of remaining hospitals. Increases in the uninsured population also lower hospital profit margins, which suggests that hospitals cannot simply pass along all increased costs onto privately insured patients.
